vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when compiling specifically crafted malicious code","description":"### Impact\n\nUsing Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods.\n\nKnown affected plugins are:\n- `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`\n- `@babel/preset-env` when using its [`useBuiltIns`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins) option\n- Any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`\n\nNo other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be.\n\n**Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted.**\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2`.\n\nBabel 6 does not receive security fixes anymore (see [Babel's security policy](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/policy)), hence there is no patch planned for `babel-traverse@6`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Upgrade `@babel/traverse` to v7.23.2 or higher. You can do this by deleting it from your package manager's lockfile and re-installing the dependencies. `@babel/core` >=7.23.2 will automatically pull in a non-vulnerable version.\n- If you cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above, upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions:\n  - `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6\n  -

character.  Such an approach is always risky, as it is so easy to forget to include an invalid character in the list.  A safer approach is to validate entity names against the XML specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#sec-common-syn - an ENTITY name is a Name:\n\n```\n[4]   NameStartChar ::= \":\" | [A-Z] | \"_\" | [a-z] | [#xC0-#xD6] | [#xD8-#xF6] | [#xF8-#x2FF] | [#x370-#x37D] |\n                        [#x37F-#x1FFF] | [#x200C-#x200D] | [#x2070-#x218F] | [#x2C00-#x2FEF] | [#x3001-#xD7FF] |\n                        [#xF900-#xFDCF] | [#xFDF0-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#xEFFFF]\n[4a]  NameChar ::= NameStartChar | \"-\" | \".\" | [0-9] | #xB7 | [#x0300-#x036F] | [#x203F-#x2040]\n[5]   Name ::= NameStartChar (NameChar)*\n```\n\nso the safest way to validate an entity name is to build a regex to represent this expression and check whether the name given matches the regex.  (Something along the lines of `/^[name start char class][name char class]*$/`.)  There's probably a nice way to simplify the explicit list rather than typing it out verbatim using Unicode character properties, but I don't know enough to do so.","severity":"low","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-gpv5-7x3g-ghjv","type":"GHSA"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-6w63-h3fj-q4vw"},{"url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-gpv5-7x3g-ghjv"},{"url":"https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/commit/9a880b887916855c3a510869fd1ee268d7fe58b1"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gpv5-7x3g-ghjv"}],"published_at":"2023-06-15T19:05:13Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T00:28:48Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"fast-xml-parser"},"severity":"low","vulnerable_version_range":"=
