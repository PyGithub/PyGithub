Make any search that returns results:\n   ```bash\n   curl -H \"Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n        \"https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=commit:EXAMPLE_COMMIT_SHA\"\n   ```\n   **Returns**: `{\"total_count\": 1, \"items\": [...]}`\n\n2. Use PyGithub:\n   ```python\n   import github\n   from github import Auth\n\n   auth = Auth.Token(\"YOUR_TOKEN\")\n   gh = github.Github(auth=auth)\n   issues = gh.search_issues(\"commit:EXAMPLE_COMMIT_SHA\")\n   print(f\"totalCount: {issues.totalCount}\")  # Prints 0 instead of 1\n   ```\n\n## Evidence\n\n**HTTP Response** (captured with debugging):\n```json\n{\n  \"total_count\": 1,\n  \"incomplete_results\": false,\n  \"items\": [{\"number\": 12345, \"title\": \"Example PR\", ...}]\n}\n```\n\n**Response Headers**:\n```\nLink: <https://github.blog/changelog/2025-03-06-github-issues-projects-api-support-for-issues-advanced-search-and-more/>; rel=\"deprecation\"; type=\"text/html\"\n```\n\n**Parsed Links**: `{\"deprecation\": \"https://github.blog/changelog/...\"}`\n**Result**: No \"last\" link found â†’ `totalCount = 0`\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\nChange line 152 in `PaginatedList.py` from:\n```python\nif \"link\" not in headers:\n```\n\nTo:\n```python\nif \"link\" not in headers or not self.__hasPaginationLinks(headers):\n```\n\nWhere `__hasPaginationLinks()` checks for pagination-specific `rel` values (`\"next\"`, `\"prev\"`, `\"last\"`, `\"first\"`), ignoring other Link types like deprecation notices.\n\nAlternative implementation:\n```python\ndef __hasPaginationLinks(self, headers):\n    \"\"\"Check if Link header contains pagination links, not just deprecation notices\"\"\"\n    if \"link\" not in headers:\n        return False\n\n    links = self.__parseLinkHeader(headers)\n    pagination_rels = {\"next\", \"prev\", \"last\", \"first\"}\n    return any(rel in pagination_rels for rel in links.keys())\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis bug affects:\n- All search operations (`search_issues`, `search_repositories`, `search_users`, etc.)\n- Any application relying on search result counts\n- Pagination logic when GitHub includes deprecation notices\n\n**Additional Context**: This issue started appearing around early September 2025 when GitHub began including deprecation notices in API responses, breaking existing PyGithub installations that were working fine before.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3373","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3373/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3373/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3373/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3373","id":3399666591,"node_id":"I_kwDOADYVqs7Kosuf","number":3373,"title":"Broken
