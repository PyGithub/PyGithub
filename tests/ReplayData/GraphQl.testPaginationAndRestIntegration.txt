Under what conditions does this branch execute?\r\n                # Likely when total_count is less than or equal to per_page (1 now), \r\n                # meaning the first page is also the last page.\r\n                if data and \"total_count\" in data:\r\n                    self.__totalCount = data[\"total_count\"]\r\n                elif data:\r\n                    if isinstance(data, dict):\r\n                        data = data[self.__list_item]\r\n                    self.__totalCount = len(data)\r\n                else:\r\n                    self.__totalCount = 0\r\n            else:\r\n                links = self.__parseLinkHeader(headers)\r\n                lastUrl = links.get(\"last\")\r\n                if lastUrl:\r\n                    self.__totalCount = int(parse_qs(lastUrl)[\"page\"][0])\r\n                else:\r\n                    self.__totalCount = 0\r\n        return self.__totalCount  # type: ignore\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value is correct when the `total_count` is smaller than 1000. However, when the `total_count` > 1000.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the correct `total_count` value from the response, I must iterate over the results first, which invokes the `_getPage` method and updates totalCount with:\r\n```py\r\nself.__totalCount = data.get(\"total_count\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n`totalCount` should accurately reflect the `total_count` value from the response regardless of when it is accessed.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or an intentional design choice (though it’s confusing, at least for me). I hope you can either fix it or update the documentation to provide a detailed explanation of this behavior. Clarifying this will help users understand the difference and ensure they retrieve the expected value of `totalCount`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3016","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3016/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3016/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3016/events","html_url":"https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/3016","id":2456749972,"node_id":"I_kwDOADYVqs6SbweU","number":3016,"title":"Github API commit comments endpoint don't work","user":{"login":"AutoScrape123TX","id":129413195,"node_id":"U_kgDOB7awSw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129413195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX","html_url":"https://github.com/AutoScrape123TX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AutoScrape123TX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-08-08T22:31:15Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T22:31:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI try to gather a commit's comment list for analysis.\r\nSeems GitHub API is broken. \r\n\r\nExample : \r\n\r\n[https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/commits/2aaa4263918427ee5164f12573e1dd719d365a1b](https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/commits/2aaa4263918427ee5164f12573e1dd719d365a1b)\r\n[https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/commits/2aaa4263918427ee5164f12573e1dd719d365a1b/comments](https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/commits/2aaa4263918427ee5164f12573e1dd719d365a1b/comments)\r\n\r\nWhile we see clearly there's comments on the commit present on GitHub...

It only builds the `UnknownObjectException` if the message is \"not found\" but the 404 HTTP response when requesting an unknown branch has the message \"Branch not found\".\r\n```\r\n      elif status == 404 and message == \"not found\":\r\n            exc = GithubException.UnknownObjectException\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any reason that we are checking the contents of the message and not just the HTTP status code?
