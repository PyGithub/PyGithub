The following versions should be updated to as soon as possible:\n\n[C#](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qv8q-v995-72gr) 3.0.2  \nD 3.0.1  \n[Dart](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4xh4-v2pq-jvhm) 3.0.3  \nElixir 3.0.0  \n[Go](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hv53-vf5m-8q94) 3.0.1  \n[Java](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q3vw-4jx3-rrr2) 3.3.0  \n[JavaScript](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vpgc-7h78-gx8f) 3.1.0  \nKotlin 1.1.0  \nLua 3.0.1  \n[PHP](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p6g-gjp8-ggg9) 3.0.2  \nPerl 3.0.0  \n[Python](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxq3-5249-8hgg) 3.0.2  \n[Ruby](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp9c-fpxx-744v) 3.0.1  \n[Rust](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-28r9-pq4c-wp3c) 3.0.0  \nScala 3.0.1  \nSwift 1.0.1  \n\nIf you are using any of the earlier packages, please update to latest.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue arrieses from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the last four digits of the personnummer to be\n000, which is invalid.
