Becaue it is missing in the reference on the website.\n\nI think we should discuss the naming of this function. OF has methods like `ofGetHeight()` for getting the height of the app and `ofGetScreenHeight()` for getting the height of the screen. Instead `ofImage_<PixelType>::grabScreen`[1] does not grab the screen. I tested this on arch/ubuntu/win7 and it only grabs the app (everything else is black). Maybe it should be renamed to only `ofImage_<PixelType>::grab`.

Sometimes the app shows 300+ FPS sometimes +60 sometimes 30 when setting ofSetVerticalSync(true) and ofSetFramerate(60) (or using none of the settings), and I experience some slowdowns in the ofxOpenNI thread to 20 FPS when playing an .oni file, that recover back to normal 30 FPS. Sometimes the app runs perfectly with no slow downs but it is pretty much randomly changeing even with just  an app restart or system restart. No changes in the Nvidia driver settings seem to directly and repeatetly control the FPS. The ofxOpenCV example is controlable and behaves as one would expect, but its not threaded.\n\nI am puzzeld and I do not know what could be the root of the problem. Any ideas where I could look next? Are there any instructions or patterns i should avoid when interacting with my OpenNI thread that could influence the Opengl thread?\n\nAnyone wanting to test this can reproduce this with running the sample project of gameovers ofxOpenNI called src-ONIRecording-Simple.

This would lower the barrier for people getting addons they want/need. Additionally, it would take away/reduce the need/desire to include popular addons in the OF core repo and/or release download, if addons are so easy to get, as part of a workflow we already envision the users to follow in the future (i.e. the PG)\r\n\r\n*Behaviour as it is now/soon:*\r\n\r\nAlice has an idea for a new project. She needs a couple addons for realising her project, and knows which ones. \r\nShe opens a browser to go to ofxaddons.com and/or github to download the addons if she doesn't have them yet and places them into `OF/addons/`. Alice starts the PG. The PG knows about the addons, and allows her to select them for inclusion. She creates a project and starts coding.\r\n\r\n*Desired/envisioned behaviour:*\r\n\r\nBob has an idea for a new project. He needs a couple addons for realising his project, and knows which ones. \r\nBob uses the new version of the PG to create a project. Beside the list of installed addons, the PG offers a dropdown list to select addons to download and place into the proper place. It lets Bob select if he prefers a plain download (to just use the addon), or a cloned git repo (to stay up-to-date and/or propose improvements to the addon author). Bob selects the desired addons to download, waits a while until PG reports that they're in place, and chooses all needed addons from the newly expanded list. He creates a project, and start coding the Next Big Thing, without even needing the browser! Awesome, right?\r\n\r\n*Analysis:*\r\n\r\nAlthough I realize that this is no trivial feature, I think much of what we need is already in place. \r\nPG knows about the repo structure, which addons are already there, etc., and has most of the file-manipulation logic already I think. \r\nofxaddons.com maintains a list of available addons and their locations, so I hope it's rather easy to present this in some machine-readable way for PG consumption (@obviousjim, thoughts?). \r\nWget/curl/git could take care of the download. \r\nofxGUI would have to be extended with a dropdown list, or some other way of (space)efficiently presenting the huge list of addons available.\r\n\r\nPossible issues: \r\nCross-platform way of downloading/git cloning without pulling to many dependencies (Elliot brought this up I think). Maybe have a fallback chain of mechanisms?\r\nAddon structure may not comply to what is expected (for old addons e.g.), so the project wouldn't work in the beginning. The same issue would appear on manual download, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts and Feedback, please.

!\r\n\r\nRecently, I've been in lot of languages, from C++ to ruby, passing by the colosus of javascript and the sea of php. Dropping by various and strange framework such as the Cinder, the jQuery, the Rails, the Processing, etc ...\r\n\r\n## the situation \r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed is that a strong architecture and a really ease use of add-ons makes a framework get stronger. For instance, if we take a look at Ruby, we see that the use of gems give him a powerfull advance over his friend php. \r\n\r\n### the Rubyist\r\n\r\nThis way of thinking is getting even better with the http://gembundler.com/ [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) friend. The gems have dependencies and a simple GemFile help to easily install all dependencies for one project.\r\n\r\n### the Cinderist\r\n\r\nFor Cinder, we get the block, as for OSX, it quiet easy and fast. Drag and drop and play/code.\r\n\r\n### the jQueryist\r\n\r\nWell, it is not frequent to have jQuery plugins depending on other jQuery plugins, but there are several way to handle dependencies on jQuery and JS.\r\n\r\n### the nodist\r\n\r\nThis lead us to http://npmjs.org/, which is really nice with dependencies.\r\nFor instance, if you tried cloud9ide, you know that you just have to make sure you get the proper package.json :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"node-example\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"express\": \"2.2.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file ensure that everything before running the server will be installed via npm.\r\n\r\n### the ofist\r\n\r\nRight now, we just have the addons.make file, which is nice but does not do any lifting for us. We have to verify that the ofx addons has been downloaded and is installed in the right folder.\r\n\r\n- Why not creating a script that will allow to manage dependencies compilation ? \r\nI have this wonderful ofxJSONsettings, but he depends on [JSONCPP](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/) and on boost, so here we will have :\r\n\r\npackage.json file in the ofxJSONsettings folder :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxJSONsettings\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"jsoncpp\": \"0.6.0-rc2\"\r\n    \"url\":\"http://jsoncpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp/trunk/\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"svn\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHum, then, we have our little bash script :\r\n\r\n`xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings`\r\n\r\nand for a project, we have to ensure that the make file run `xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings` if it does not find ofXJSONsettings.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to simplify and easify the use of plugin ! Hey, I want the new [mistubaRenderer](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxMitsubaRenderer) let's give a try :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxMitsubaRenderer\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"mitsuba\": \"0.1\"\r\n    \"url\":\"https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/hg/mitsuba-bidir\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"hg\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, this would be simplify if everybody use some same pattern, and respect some convention.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think about that ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","id":3614231,"number":1062,"title":"regularize

now there is a lot of duplicated code in the vector math classes. for example, normalize() and getNormalized() have separate implementations. if we follow the pattern of always implementing things in self-modifying methods, then providing copy-returning methods as alternatives, this will reduce the amount of code and make it harder to cause bugs or behavioral discrepancies.\r\n\r\n- implementations of an algorithm should always be self-modifying\r\n- copy-returning versions should be implemented using a differently named method, internally making a copy and calling the self-modifying version on the copy.\r\n\r\ne.g. something like (note, this isn't how it's implemented right now):\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f& ofVec2f::normalize() {\r\n\t\tfloat length = (float)sqrt(x*x
