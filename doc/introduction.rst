Introduction
============

PyGithub is a Python (2 and 3) library to use the `Github API v3 <http://developer.github.com/v3>`__.
With it, you can manage your `Github <http://github.com>`__ resources (repositories, user profiles, organizations, etc.) from Python scripts.

Should you have any question, any remark, or if you find a bug,
or if there is something you can do with the API but not with PyGithub,
please `open an issue <https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues>`__.

(Very short) tutorial
---------------------

First create a Github instance::

    from github import Github
    
    # using username and password
    g = Github("user", "password")
    
    # or using an access token
    g = Github("access_token")

Then play with your Github objects::

    for repo in g.get_user().get_repos():
        print(repo.name)
        repo.edit(has_wiki=False)

Download and install
--------------------

This package is in the `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyGithub>`__, so ``pip install PyGithub`` should
be enough.  You can also clone it on `Github
<http://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub>`__.

If you wish to use GitHub Integrations, you'll want to be sure to install the
'integrations' option: ``pip install PyGithub['integrations']``

Licensing
---------

PyGithub is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence.
See files COPYING and COPYING.LESSER, as requested by `GNU <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html>`__.
