This would lower the barrier for people getting addons they want/need. Additionally, it would take away/reduce the need/desire to include popular addons in the OF core repo and/or release download, if addons are so easy to get, as part of a workflow we already envision the users to follow in the future (i.e. the PG)\r\n\r\n*Behaviour as it is now/soon:*\r\n\r\nAlice has an idea for a new project. She needs a couple addons for realising her project, and knows which ones. \r\nShe opens a browser to go to ofxaddons.com and/or github to download the addons if she doesn't have them yet and places them into `OF/addons/`. Alice starts the PG. The PG knows about the addons, and allows her to select them for inclusion. She creates a project and starts coding.\r\n\r\n*Desired/envisioned behaviour:*\r\n\r\nBob has an idea for a new project. He needs a couple addons for realising his project, and knows which ones. \r\nBob uses the new version of the PG to create a project. Beside the list of installed addons, the PG offers a dropdown list to select addons to download and place into the proper place. It lets Bob select if he prefers a plain download (to just use the addon), or a cloned git repo (to stay up-to-date and/or propose improvements to the addon author). Bob selects the desired addons to download, waits a while until PG reports that they're in place, and chooses all needed addons from the newly expanded list. He creates a project, and start coding the Next Big Thing, without even needing the browser! Awesome, right?\r\n\r\n*Analysis:*\r\n\r\nAlthough I realize that this is no trivial feature, I think much of what we need is already in place. \r\nPG knows about the repo structure, which addons are already there, etc., and has most of the file-manipulation logic already I think. \r\nofxaddons.com maintains a list of available addons and their locations, so I hope it's rather easy to present this in some machine-readable way for PG consumption (@obviousjim, thoughts?). \r\nWget/curl/git could take care of the download. \r\nofxGUI would have to be extended with a dropdown list, or some other way of (space)efficiently presenting the huge list of addons available.\r\n\r\nPossible issues: \r\nCross-platform way of downloading/git cloning without pulling to many dependencies (Elliot brought this up I think). Maybe have a fallback chain of mechanisms?\r\nAddon structure may not comply to what is expected (for old addons e.g.), so the project wouldn't work in the beginning. The same issue would appear on manual download, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts and Feedback, please. :-)","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1233","comments":2,"milestone":null,"number":1233,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1233","assignee":null,"title":"PG should offer addons download","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/addon","name":"addon","color":"d68e22"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/project+generator","name":"project generator","color":"444444"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-05-01T20:15:17Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442},"id":4373201,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-02T16:11:13Z","body":"should result in a gray circle, instead its white \r\n\r\n\tofColor c(255, 0, 0);\r\n\tc.setSaturation(0);\t\r\n\tofSetColor(c);\r\n\tofFill();\t\r\n\tofCircle(100,400,50);\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1232","comments":11,"milestone":{"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/5","number":5,"title":"0072 Release","closed_issues":21,"due_on":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","open_issues":81,"created_at":"2011-12-02T15:29:48Z","state":"open","description":"","id":61810},"number":1232,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1232","assignee":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylemcdonald","gravatar_id":"e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"kylemcdonald","id":157106},"title":"bug/feature in ofColor::setSaturation ","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-05-01T17:40:08Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofTheo","gravatar_id":"3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"ofTheo","id":144000},"id":4370619,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-01T06:35:54Z","body":"How do you feel about passing matrices to ofShader as a uniform?\r\n\r\nsomething like:\r\n\r\n\tvoid ofShader::setUniformMatrix4fv(const char* name, ofMatrix& matrix ) {\r\n\t\tif(bLoaded)\r\n\t\t\tglUniformMatrix4fv(getUniformLocation(name), 1, GL_FALSE, matrix.getPtr());\r\n\t}","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1229","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":1229,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1229","assignee":null,"title":"pass matrices as uniforms with ofShader ","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/section-3D","name":"section-3D","color":"DDDDDD"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-04-30T19:49:38Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larsberg","gravatar_id":"bb9a4f7c510339e9d7a447347dc263ba","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bb9a4f7c510339e9d7a447347dc263ba?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"Larsberg","id":346072},"id":4356530,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-04T12:43:13Z","body":"@julapy do we need to add resources that are in bin/data/ to the xcode project for them to get copied to the device?

parameters based on a 'view portal' defined by 3 points (top left, bottom left, bottom right)\r\n\r\nCurrently the changes involve editing ofBaseRenderer (and therefore all other renderers) to support lensOffset parameter (default 0,0).

size of the int type on the platform you are compiling for).\r\nThe problem is due to an incorrect cast in the ostringstream operation inside the loop.\r\nInstead of directly casting the (signed) char from the input character to an unsigned int, the input character must first be cast to an unsigned char.\r\nIn other words, instead of:\r\n```   out << setfill('0') << setw(2) << hex << (unsigned int)

Poco gives us this for free, so it doesn't seem like a huge stretch to think of something like this, plus find and replace, etc.    Would make the regex example much shorter. \r\n\r\np5 has something similar, if that's a helpful argument: \r\n\r\nhttp://processing.org/reference/matchAll_.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\tvector < string > ofxRegex::getMatchedStrings (string contents, string regex );\r\n\tvector < string > ofxRegex::getMatchedStrings (string contents, string regex ){\r\n    \r\n\t    vector < string > results;\r\n\t    RegularExpression regEx(regex);\r\n\t    RegularExpression::Match match;\r\n    \r\n\t    while(regEx.match(contents, match) != 0) {\r\n        \r\n\t        // we get the sub string from the content\r\n\t        // and then trim the content so that we\r\n\t        // can continue to search \r\n\t        string foundStr = contents.substr(match.offset, match.length);\r\n\t        contents = contents.substr(match.offset + match.length);\r\n        \r\n\t        results.push_back(foundStr);\r\n        \r\n\t    }\r\n\t    return results;\r\n\t}","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1110","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":1110,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1110","assignee":null,"title":"add a simple regex function like ofSplitString()","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/fix-proposed","name":"fix-proposed","color":"31e03a"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-25T18:56:37Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71","login":"ofZach","id":142897},"id":3799872,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-25T18:50:13Z","body":"code to recreate: \r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::setup(){\r\n    system(\"pwd;\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::update(){\r\n     system(\"pwd;\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::draw(){\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::keyPressed(int key){\r\n    cout << ofToDataPath(\"temp\") << endl;\r\n}\r\n\r\nproduces: \r\n\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n../../../data/temp\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin/emptyExampleDebug.app/Contents/MacOS\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin/emptyExampleDebug.app/Contents/MacOS\r\n\r\nthis is because the code that fixes OSX paths isn't called until you call ofToDataPath().  a good fix I think would be to set ofDataPathRoot (which happens in ofToDataPath) somewhere early in ofRunApp().

Dropping by various and strange framework such as the Cinder, the jQuery, the Rails, the Processing, etc ...\r\n\r\n## the situation \r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed is that a strong architecture and a really ease use of add-ons makes a framework get stronger. For instance, if we take a look at Ruby, we see that the use of gems give him a powerfull advance over his friend php. \r\n\r\n### the Rubyist\r\n\r\nThis way of thinking is getting even better with the http://gembundler.com/ [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) friend. The gems have dependencies and a simple GemFile help to easily install all dependencies for one project.\r\n\r\n### the Cinderist\r\n\r\nFor Cinder, we get the block, as for OSX, it quiet easy and fast. Drag and drop and play/code.\r\n\r\n### the jQueryist\r\n\r\nWell, it is not frequent to have jQuery plugins depending on other jQuery plugins, but there are several way to handle dependencies on jQuery and JS.\r\n\r\n### the nodist\r\n\r\nThis lead us to http://npmjs.org/, which is really nice with dependencies.\r\nFor instance, if you tried cloud9ide, you know that you just have to make sure you get the proper package.json :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"node-example\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"express\": \"2.2.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file ensure that everything before running the server will be installed via npm.\r\n\r\n### the ofist\r\n\r\nRight now, we just have the addons.make file, which is nice but does not do any lifting for us. We have to verify that the ofx addons has been downloaded and is installed in the right folder.\r\n\r\n- Why not creating a script that will allow to manage dependencies compilation ? \r\nI have this wonderful ofxJSONsettings, but he depends on [JSONCPP](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/) and on boost, so here we will have :\r\n\r\npackage.json file in the ofxJSONsettings folder :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxJSONsettings\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"jsoncpp\": \"0.6.0-rc2\"\r\n    \"url\":\"http://jsoncpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp/trunk/\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"svn\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHum, then, we have our little bash script :\r\n\r\n`xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings`\r\n\r\nand for a project, we have to ensure that the make file run `xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings` if it does not find ofXJSONsettings.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to simplify and easify the use of plugin ! Hey, I want the new [mistubaRenderer](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxMitsubaRenderer) let's give a try :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxMitsubaRenderer\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"mitsuba\": \"0.1\"\r\n    \"url\":\"https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/hg/mitsuba-bidir\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"hg\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, this would be simplify if everybody use some same pattern, and respect some convention.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think about that ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n\r\n\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1063","comments":7,"milestone":null,"number":1063,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1063","assignee":null,"title":"Automatic installer + dependencies handler","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/addon","name":"addon","color":"d68e22"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-13T10:44:57Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielstuff","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/390ea42c23c2c383f973abdafa24bb07?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"390ea42c23c2c383f973abdafa24bb07","login":"gabrielstuff","id":285033},"id":3627067,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-12T17:58:20Z","body":"right now there is a lot of duplicated code in the vector math classes. for example, normalize() and getNormalized() have separate implementations. if we follow the pattern of always implementing things in self-modifying methods, then providing copy-returning methods as alternatives, this will reduce the amount of code and make it harder to cause bugs or behavioral discrepancies.\r\n\r\n- implementations of an algorithm should always be self-modifying\r\n- copy-returning versions should be implemented using a differently named method, internally making a copy and calling the self-modifying version on the copy.\r\n\r\ne.g. something like (note, this isn't how it's implemented right now):\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f& ofVec2f::normalize() {\r\n\t\tfloat length = (float)sqrt(x*x + y*y);\r\n\t\tif( length > 0 ) {\r\n\t\t\tx /= length;\r\n\t\t\ty /= length;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn *this;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f ofVec2f::getNormalized() const {\r\n\t\tofVec2f result = *this;\r\n\t\treturn result.normalize();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\ntaken from this post https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1061#issuecomment-4455601","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","comments":4,"milestone":{"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/5","number":5,"closed_issues":21,"title":"0072 Release","due_on":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","open_issues":81,"created_at":"2011-12-02T15:29:48Z","state":"open","description":"","id":61810},"number":1062,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","assignee":null,"title":"regularize code for math addons","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-12T16:33:06Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylemcdonald","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528","login":"kylemcdonald","id":157106},"id":3614231,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-13T13:07:11Z","body":"Just saw this is the documentation.\r\nVertexes is incorrect (wrong plural)\r\nVertices","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1055","comments":18,"milestone":null,"number":1055,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1055","assignee":null,"title":"ofVertexes??
