Looking at GithubObject.py I see several references to __completed and one to _completed (single underscore) on line 72. Changing line 72 to use a double underscore removed the repeated calls to Github.\r\n\r\nI tried to run your tests but can't figure out how to do so? I'd have left you a pull request if so. I tried \"python -m unittest discover\" and also just running the files, I'm not familiar with the format you've used. I'm happy to run with logs etc if that's useful (some guidance on how to run the tests would be super helpful too).
