testing opencvExample against current openCV 2.3.1 static libs in Code::Blocks the application always quits. Debug only shows that this is a SIGSEGV on either cvThreshold or cvFindContour (depending on whether you comment one or the other out). Stack trace is not very helpful, but reports segmentation fault on cv::thresh_8u.\n\nAfter a lot of testing I believe this is a quite specific bug in openCV relating to SSE/SSE2 and optimization level of the build.

With openCV compiled with SSE/SSE2 on, release and -O3 there IS problems - eg., cvThreshold and cvFindContours crash with SIGSEGV. Current openCV libs in develop seem to be compiled with these settings as they exhibit same crash pattern.\n2. With openCV compiled with SSE/SSE2 off, release and -O3 there is no problem.\n3. With openCV compiled with SSE/SSE2 on, debug and -O3 there is no problem.\n4. With openCV compiled with SSE/SSE2 on, release and -O1 there is no problem. (you can find these here: https://github.com/gameoverhack/openframeworks/tree/bugfix-openCV231)\n\nI am using cmake 2.8, latest openCV downloaded from sourceforge (not SVN) mingw 4.4.1 on a native win 7 box (core 2 duo 4gb ram - fresh install).\n\nBefore making a pull request I figure there needs to be input from everyone about:\na) do we turn SSE/SSE2 off? - I think this will affect efficiency for many functions\nb) what is the difference in efficiency with -O1 vs -O3?\nc) can someone on a machine with more modern GCC manage to compile with -O2\nd) people need to test these libs to see if they are stable\ne) some other magic ;-)\n\nif it is helpful I can upload the many different versions of the libs I have compiled for testing, but #4 above is the only combo with SSE/SSE2 that ran on my machine - which is fairly common configuration...","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1253","comments":3,"milestone":{"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","login":"bilderbuchi","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":327442},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/4","number":4,"title":"0071 Release","due_on":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","closed_issues":70,"open_issues":0,"created_at":"2011-12-02T15:29:28Z","state":"closed","description":"","id":61808},"number":1253,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1253","assignee":null,"title":"openCV mingw32 libs crash","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/addon","name":"addon","color":"d68e22"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"b31d1d"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/fix-proposed","name":"fix-proposed","color":"31e03a"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/critical","name":"critical","color":"ff0000"}],"closed_at":"2012-05-15T19:35:49Z","created_at":"2012-05-12T13:19:39Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/gameoverhack","gravatar_id":"397ac2141aace0681a354185e7efb0f1","login":"gameoverhack","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/397ac2141aace0681a354185e7efb0f1?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":331599},"id":4546918,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"patch_url":null,"diff_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-10T17:13:40Z","body":"When binding a texture to an ofBox on iOS, it seems to render oddly where certain sides are transparent.

all,\r\n\r\nI started rewriting ofThread in Detroit but stopped do to other priorities. Now it's essentially done and much cleaner then what I started with .. wheew. In any case, it's been rewritten using Poco::Thread and Poco::Runnable and the resulting code is much cleaner and hopefully easier to maintain ... no platform specific stuff.\r\n\r\nPoco::Thread provides some nice things like unique ids, thread sleep(), yield(), and knowing which thread you are in. The verbosity prints now uses an ofLog module with the current thread id and the mutex lock()/unlock() verbose prints now tell you if the thread itself or another thread is trying to lock/unlock it.\r\n\r\nThe verbose output looks like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nThread 1: OF_VERBOSE: started\r\nThread 1: OF_VERBOSE: thread waiting for mutex to be unlocked\r\nThread 1: OF_VERBOSE: thread locked mutex\r\nThread 1: OF_VERBOSE: thread unlocked mutex\r\nThread 1: OF_VERBOSE: waiting for mutex to be unlocked\r\nThread 1: OF_VERBOSE: mutex locked\r\nThread 1: OF_VERBOSE: mutex unlocked\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSorry Kyle, getCurrentThread() returns a pointer. How else can you either return an object or not if there isn't one? :D\r\n\r\nIn any case, I tested this with the threadExample and it's working fine. I'd appreciate others trying it out, especially on Windows. I noticed a bug last week on Windows with the original ofThread where starting the same thread multiple times *spawns new threads*. I assume Poco::Thread dosen't let that happen so this bug should be gone.\r\n\r\nAlso, from talking with Damian about what's needed for Threads, I added an ofSemaphore typedef of Poco::Semaphore.\r\n\r\nP.S. The commenting comes from me working out how ofThread is supposed to work internally by reading the code for both the rewrite and the site documentation. I normally do this when I write an API and I figured I'd leave it in for now. I can remove it if the \"no header commenting\" unwritten rule is in force ...","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1031","comments":15,"milestone":null,"number":1031,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1031","assignee":null,"title":"ofThread rewrite & ofSemaphore typedef","labels":[],"closed_at":"2012-03-11T13:15:21Z","created_at":"2012-03-04T04:10:39Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/danomatika","gravatar_id":"5fa1d3aa502b308b8a3ae814fb88ac04","login":"danomatika","id":480637,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5fa1d3aa502b308b8a3ae814fb88ac04?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"id":3494366,"pull_request":{"diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1031.diff","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1031","patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1031.patch"}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-07T01:58:41Z","body":"the pdf example was too complicated for beginners (eg. dropZone, drag and drop, matrix stuff for rotation, vectors of images and tail...) and it had no comments.\r\n\r\ni simplified by only having one rectangle moving randomly.\r\ni tried to make even basic stuff understandable by adding a lot of comments.\r\n\r\ni also demonstrated rendering multiple frames into a single page pdf versus a multipage pdf.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1030","comments":2,"milestone":null,"number":1030,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1030","assignee":null,"title":"example: simpler pdf example plus added comments","labels":[],"closed_at":"2012-03-07T01:58:41Z","created_at":"2012-03-03T21:15:06Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/liasomething","gravatar_id":"248569b4b21882f854f3a0eee701cc37","login":"liasomething","id":183150,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/248569b4b21882f854f3a0eee701cc37?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"id":3492273,"pull_request":{"diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1030.diff","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1030","patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1030.patch"}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-03T16:05:10Z","body":"currently it's  `ofSaveImage(ofPixels& pixels, string filename)`, etc\r\nshould be `ofSaveImage(const ofPixels& pixels, string filename)`\r\n\r\nthere's lots of const correctness issues in general\r\ni'm not sure if littlering the git issue log with them all individually is a good idea\r\nperhaps an issue like 'fix general const correctness'","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1027","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":1027,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1027","assignee":null,"title":"ofSaveImage doesn't accept const","labels":[],"closed_at":"2012-03-03T16:05:10Z","created_at":"2012-03-03T11:48:14Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods","gravatar_id":"bea30676dca310e7f38269f245214944","login":"elliotwoods","id":328294,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bea30676dca310e7f38269f245214944?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"id":3489150,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-02T23:17:56Z","body":"Very minor OpenGL ES tweaks were needed.

The issue is a change in the pin numbering used in the Firmata library for the standard (ATMega168 and ATMega328 based) Arduinos. This commit fixes the issue while maintaining backwards compatibility with previous versions of firmata. I have also updated the firmataExample example to demonstrate how to set analog pins as digital I/O pins (this was previously broken) and also how to control a servo motor.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of new features in Firmata 2.3 that can make it easier to use Arduino with OF (and other frameworks). However ofArduino currently supports 3 different versions of Firmata so to add new features and maintain backwards compatibility would be a pain (not to mention a mess). In the near future I plan to create a new addon ofxArduino (or ofxFirmata) that will take full advantage of Firmata 2.3, adding support for pretty much any board that can be programmed via the Arduino IDE as well as new features such as I2C support (which is now part of StandardFirmata). I think ofArduino should remain as is to provide backwards compatibility, and the new addon will only support Firmata 2.3 (Arduino 1.0) and higher.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/768","comments":3,"milestone":null,"number":768,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/768","assignee":null,"title":"Bugfix ofArduino update to be compatible with Arduino 1.0","labels":[],"closed_at":"2011-10-17T06:47:33Z","created_at":"2011-10-09T06:07:35Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/soundanalogous","gravatar_id":"f3ca5c4c2359e9103ba20a1ea992680c","login":"soundanalogous","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f3ca5c4c2359e9103ba20a1ea992680c?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":401539},"id":1855139,"pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/768.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/768","diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/768.diff"}},{"updated_at":"2011-12-03T23:44:15Z","body":"when using the movieGrabber on osx (10.6 in my case) There are a bunch of warnings like this\r\n\r\nmovieGrabberExampleDebug[2351:903] *** __NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x1410280 of class NSCFArray autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking\r\n\r\nthere seem to be some memory leaks in ofQuickTimeGrabber. according to Instruments, those are in listDevices(),  loadSettings() and qtSelectDevice \r\n\r\nmore info + screenshot of Instruments session\r\nhttp://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,7474.0.html","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/763","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":763,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/763","assignee":null,"title":"ofQuickTimeGrabber::listDevices memory leak","labels":[],"closed_at":"2011-12-03T23:44:15Z","created_at":"2011-10-02T09:30:42Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/jesusgollonet","gravatar_id":"5008d5295e9bc2636313c7b50ed5981d","login":"jesusgollonet","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5008d5295e9bc2636313c7b50ed5981d?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":31100},"id":1794924,"pull_request":{"patch_url":null,"html_url":null,"diff_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2011-10-17T23:21:32Z","body":"Changed saveFile methods in ofxXmlSettings to return a boolean on success/failure to save a file...this let's you catch errors if it's not possible to save an xml file during or after modifications. \r\n\r\n(It's pretty basic, but figure I should start somewhere helping out ;-)","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/762","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":762,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/762","assignee":null,"title":"Bugfix return bool on save xml","labels":[],"closed_at":"2011-10-17T23:21:32Z","created_at":"2011-09-29T11:43:43Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/gameoverhack","gravatar_id":"397ac2141aace0681a354185e7efb0f1","login":"gameoverhack","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/397ac2141aace0681a354185e7efb0f1?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":331599},"id":1774106,"pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/762.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/762","diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/762.diff"}},{"updated_at":"2012-02-25T03:57:37Z","body":"Why is ofLog [adding a space after the ostream (&#060;&#060;) operator](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/blob/master/libs/openFrameworks/utils/ofLog.h#L73)?\r\n\r\nThis does not match the expected behavior of cout and cerr which ofLog is modeled after.

(Xcode 3.2.6, iOS 4.2). The same code works fine on Mac OS X, although I don't have a iOS device currently to test with.\r\n\r\nFor example, attempting to draw this square:\r\n```\r\nofSetColor(255,0,0,0);  \r\nofFill();  \r\nofBeginShape();  \r\nofVertex(10, 10);  \r\nofVertex(10, 85);  \r\nofVertex(85, 85);  \r\nofVertex(85, 10);  \r\nofVertex(10, 10);  \r\nofEndShape();  \r\n```\r\nresults in nothing being drawn in the iOS simulator. ofTriangle() and ofRect() don't suffer the problem as they don't use ofPath to get drawn.\r\n\r\nIn the debugger, I'm finding that when the above polygon is tessellated in ofPath::tessellate(), the cachedTessellation mesh has the correct vertices, but has an indices list of {0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0} which is probably why it doesn't render (ie. duplicate consecutive indices within the same triangle. The vertices under OS X are the same, but the indices list looks more sensible.)\r\n\r\nCAUSE\r\nThe problem appears to be that ofTessellator::performTessellation() incorrectly assumes that:\r\n```\r\nsizeof(ofIndexType) == sizeof(TESSindex)\r\n```\r\nwhen it calls:\r\n```\r\ndstmesh.addIndices((ofIndexType*)tessGetElements(cacheTess),numIndices);\r\n```\r\nWhen building for iOS, this assumption is not true. ofIndexType is GLushort while TESSindex is int.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\nThe following patch fixes the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/libs/openFrameworks/graphics/ofTessellator.cpp b/libs/openFrameworks/graphics/ofTessellator.cpp\r\nindex 68fdd65..03fde46 100644\r\n--- a/libs/openFrameworks/graphics/ofTessellator.cpp\r\n+++ b/libs/openFrameworks/graphics/ofTessellator.cpp\r\n@@ -1,3 +1,5 @@\r\n+#include <assert.h>\r\n+\r\n #include \"ofTessellator.h\"\r\n \r\n \r\n@@ -146,7 +148,18 @@ void ofTessellator::performTessellation(ofPolyWindingMode polyWindingMode, ofMes\r\n \r\n \tdstmesh.clear();\r\n \tdstmesh.addVertices((ofVec3f*)tessGetVertices(cacheTess),numVertexes);\r\n-\tdstmesh.addIndices((ofIndexType*)tessGetElements(cacheTess),numIndices);\r\n+\r\n+\r\n+\t// If assertion fails, can safely replace following loop with more efficient:\r\n+\t//\t\tdstmesh.addIndices((ofIndexType*)tessGetElements(cacheTess),numIndices);\r\n+\tassert(sizeof(ofIndexType) != sizeof(TESSindex));\r\n+\tconst TESSindex* indices = tessGetElements(cacheTess);\r\n+\tfor (int i = 0; i < numIndices; ++i)\r\n+\t{\r\n+\t\tofIndexType index = indices[i];\r\n+\t\tdstmesh.addIndices(&index, 1);\r\n+\t}\r\n+\r\n\t/*ofIndexType * tessElements = (ofIndexType *)tessGetElements(cacheTess);\r\n\tfor(int i=0;i<numIndices;i++){\r\n\t\tif(tessElements[i]!=TESS_UNDEF)\r\n\r\n\r\n```","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/602","comments":11,"milestone":null,"number":602,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/602","assignee":null,"title":"Rendering/tessellation of polygons fails in iOS simulator","labels":[],"closed_at":"2011-07-01T18:54:36Z","created_at":"2011-06-13T02:34:29Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-user32","gravatar_id":"5934b87b143f3bc860a2da7387f42de9","login":"github-user32","id":447669,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5934b87b143f3bc860a2da7387f42de9?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"id":1047273,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2011-06-12T14:02:35Z","body":"without this, projects outside the OF won't compile since poco isn't found.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/601","comments":0,"milestone":null,"number":601,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/601","assignee":null,"title":"fixed wrong paths for poco libs in Makefile under Linux","labels":[],"closed_at":"2011-06-12T14:02:35Z","created_at":"2011-06-09T19:45:19Z","state":"closed","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/benben","gravatar_id":"614a4e493d7c353296519bba720e77c5","login":"benben","id":124513,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/614a4e493d7c353296519bba720e77c5?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"id":1032181,"pull_request":{"diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/601.diff","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/601","patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/601.patch"}},{"updated_at":"2011-06-12T14:03:21Z","body":"","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/600","comments":0,"milestone":null,"number":600,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/600","assignee":null,"title":"Fix for minor errors.

Also, there is a stray cppunit.a missing in the example projects /libs/poco too (we don't even need the osx folder here i guess in the projects?). I've fixed the empty example, which compiles and works now, some of the other examples (e.g. videograbber) doesn't link though. I\"ll leave that to the video guys :)\r\n","number":542,"pull_request":{"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/542","diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/542.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/542.patch"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/542","labels":[],"id":788711,"closed_at":"2011-04-23T15:53:32Z","created_at":"2011-04-19T14:14:40Z"},{"milestone":null,"state":"closed","user":{"gravatar_id":"62d775b0fa28bcde2d9d29405d059be3","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisoshea","login":"chrisoshea","id":104786,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/62d775b0fa28bcde2d9d29405d059be3?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"title":"ofxAssimpModelLoader ref to ofFileUtils","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/540","comments":2,"assignee":null,"updated_at":"2011-04-16T10:55:23Z","body":"needs fixing in ...\r\n\r\n/addons/ofxAssimpModelLoader/src/ofxAssimpModelLoader.cpp:147: error: \r\n'ofFileUtils' has not been declared\r\n","number":540,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/540","labels":[],"id":777819,"closed_at":"2011-04-16T10:54:23Z","created_at":"2011-04-16T10:53:25Z"},{"milestone":null,"state":"closed","user":{"gravatar_id":"3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofTheo","login":"ofTheo","id":144000,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"title":"ofBuffer getNextLine - error putting file back together.","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/539","comments":0,"assignee":null,"updated_at":"2011-05-01T15:23:50Z","body":"When I use getNextLine to go through a file and recombine the file into a single string something is missing ( ie a json file can't be parsed ). \r\n\r\nUsing this code instead and stitching it back together works fine.\r\n\r\n\tstring str,strTotal;\r\n\tifstream in;\r\n\tin.open(ofToDataPath(path, true).c_str());\r\n\t\r\n\tgetline(in,str);\r\n\twhile ( in ) {\r\n\t\r\n\t\tstrTotal += str;\r\n\t\tgetline(in, str);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI'll try and see what the difference is - but in theory the result should be the same. \r\n\r\nalso possible related the size of getNextLine is never 0, it seems like the size is 1 when its done reading. \r\nis this because of the null byte?\r\nit would be good to find a clear way to know when you have reached the last line of the file.\r\n\r\n@arturoc","number":539,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/539","labels":[],"id":773449,"closed_at":"2011-05-01T15:23:50Z","created_at":"2011-04-15T13:00:12Z"},{"milestone":null,"state":"closed","user":{"gravatar_id":"a3e45d93c2d24b6ae8bbef0453065e45","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxlu","login":"roxlu","id":358809,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3e45d93c2d24b6ae8bbef0453065e45?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"title":"ofToDataPath returns incorrect path when used in constructor (Mac)","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/538","comments":2,"assignee":null,"updated_at":"2011-09-11T11:28:15Z","body":"When you call ofToDataPath(\"file.mov\",true) inside the testApp constructor (or actually before setup() is called) it returns\r\nan incorrect path.

found this link that does most of the work for video out from the iPad and iPhone via the VGA adapter:\n\nhttp://www.touchcentric.com/blog/archives/123\nhttp://github.com/robterrell/TVOutManager\n\nIt's a 2-line solution. BUT it uses undocumented APIs and mirrors the entire screen and UI. Instead of copying pixels, I think we could modify this code to automatically call the OF draw method twice and make a new opengl surface on the output surface, thereby speeding up drawing to the second display, and also only drawing opengl content and not any UI.\n\nI could see a really fancy version with options:\n\n1. No mirroring\n2. Mirror opengl (call draw twice)\n3. provide discrete draw callbacks with each display - maybe an argument to the draw callback with screen number? This might be the cleanest option, since it supports both of the
