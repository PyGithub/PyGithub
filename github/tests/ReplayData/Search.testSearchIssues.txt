It effectively works by providing a central place where clients can add callbacks and each of its functions returns a GjsDebugConnection. Once the client is done using the debugger in the way that they need to, they simply unref the connection and it will call back into the interrupt register and change the SpiderMonkey state appropriately if need be.\r\n\r\nGjsProfiler and GjsCoverage effectively work by using this interface, the former placing a hook on toplevel execution and function calls and the latter putting the script under coverage into single-step mode where we can record line hit information. It then (if requested) will require this information out to a file.\r\n\r\nQ & A:\r\n\r\n * Q: Why not use signals?\r\n * A: Signals don't provide us with a means to get a notification when the observer starts or stops observing a signal. We need this information in order to put SpiderMonkey in the right state when we need it (else keeping the debugging hooks on indefinitely will be needlessly expensive).\r\n\r\n * Q: The object ownership between GjsInterruptRegister, GjsCoverage and GjsProfiler seems strange.\r\n * A: This is an area I'd like some feedback and advice.  The design would be far more optimal if GjsCoverage and GjsProfiler took ownership of GjsinterruptRegister outside the scope of the context as opposed to within it. However, it seems like the Gjs authors wanted to be able to use the profiler with any that uses Gjs as an embedded language, which means that the profiler needed to be owned (and created by) the context. This in turn means that we need to have GjsCoverage owned by the context as well. However, it is slightly awkward, since in order to construct it we need to have clients provide the requested coverage paths and coverage output file in the form of construction properties.","score":0.13473003},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Itseez/opencv/issues/1447","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Itseez/opencv/issues/1447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Itseez/opencv/issues/1447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Itseez/opencv/issues/1447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/1447","id":19446174,"number":1447,"title":"Pull

other_date\r\ndate.dur_add(duration) => other_date\r\nduration.dur_sub(other_duration) => third_duration\r\nduration.dur_add(other_duration) =>

The remaining tasks are marked by TODOs (Update: the missing parts are completed in the 4th commit in the PR)\r\n\r\n- [x] Permission storage: permissions should be stored in ApplicationData and eventually the database, so now we have setter and getter in the ApplicationData class and the actual db operations are done inside ApplicationStorageImpl.\r\n\r\n- [x] Permission message passing (on going): It's merged from Xu,Zhang's PR #1231 .\r\nThe following comments are copied from PR #1231\r\n\r\n  This PR is related to API Access Control feature: communication functionality between extension and browser process.\r\n  In this PR, a new API is public for extension developer to enforce API permission checking. The whole API Access Control feature is composed of a few PRs. This PR is one of them. Another PR related to this feature is PR#1176:Added permission group and policy management classes.\r\nThe design document of this feature can be found from https://docs.google.com/a/intel.com/document/d/137u_gxmNaIFwVzaCkCFBJyveIdZxuAydWOkMI8oWgD0/edit#heading=h.5rkmb0mvstye\r\n\r\n- [x] Fully integrate Zhang,Xu's IPC code, make the permission definitions, method names align.\r\n\r\n- [x] Switching to async response in permission check API. After this step is done, we will have a working permission system.\r\n\r\n- [x] Permission-function register.\r\n\r\n  One extension may provide one or more (typically only one) set of APIs that are under corresponding permission label. For example, one extension may implement all the bluetooth.xxx() functions under permission name 'bluetooth', or more detailed permission name 'bluetooth.read, bluetooth.write, bluetooth.management' (it depends on how permission catagory is defined). The extension is responsible for registering its implemented functions and permissions after being loaded by extension system by calling a permission register function with it's permission-function mapping. The mapping is JSON string (being defined) which may look like\r\n```\r\n{ \"bluetooth\":  [\"bluetooth.read\", \"bluetooth.write\"] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n**The following features will be included In the next PR**\r\n- [ ] Define the permission-function register format.\r\n- [ ] Make the \"CheckAPIAccessControl\" work for in-process extensions.\r\n - [x] Move permission delegate from XwalkExternalExtension to the XwalkExtension class.\r\n - [ ] Implement permission delegate for in-process extensions.\r\n- [ ] OEM policy define and implementation.\r\n\r\n- [ ] UI dialog.\r\n\r\n- [

It's a powerful algorithm, but all the hard work would be done by the minimizers that already exist in scipy.optimize, so the additional code needed is really not very much.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the documentation notes:\r\n\r\nBasin hopping is a random algorithm which attempts to find the global minimum of a smooth scalar function of one or more variables.  The algorithm was originally described by David Wales http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/ .  The algorithm is iterative with each iteration composed of the following steps\r\n\r\n    1) random displacement of the coordinates\r\n\r\n    2) local minimization\r\n\r\n    3) accept or reject the new coordinates based on the minimized function\r\n    value.\r\n\r\nThis global minimization method has been shown to be extremely efficient on a wide variety of problems in physics and chemistry.  It is especially efficient when the function has many minima separated by large barriers.  See the cambridge cluster database http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/CCD.html for database of molecular systems that have been optimized primarily using basin hopping.  This database includes minimization problems exceeding 300 degrees of freedom.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJake\r\n\r\np.s. this is my first submission\r\n\r\np.p.s.

Other than the custom kernel, we're up to date as far as the bootloader goes and all other packages (inc OMXPlayer - 0.3.0 installed to try and fix this issue).\r\n\r\nUsually, the hang will occur at the end of the video. OMXPlayer doesn't quit, doesn't print any messages to the log.\r\n\r\nWe're invoking omxplayer as follows:\r\nDISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/omxplayer -o local --win \"0 0 160 96\" /content/file.mp4 </tmp/omxplayer\r\n\r\n/tmp/omxplayer is a fifo that is created by my program.\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed any light on the matter?
