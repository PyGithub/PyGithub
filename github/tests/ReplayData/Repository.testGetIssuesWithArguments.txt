for PyGithub, it is easy to use and very complete. I just successfully used it to convert Trac tickets to Guthub issues.\r\n\r\nBut I had to learn the hard way that `create_issue()` expectes the milestone as number instead of a title. To track this down, I added the following `print` statement to `Requester.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef __statusCheckedRequest( self, verb, url, parameters, input ):\r\n    status, headers, output = self.__rawRequest( verb, url, parameters, input )\r\n    if status < 200 or status >= 300:\r\n        print output # <--- Added by me.\r\n        raise UnknownGithubObject() # <--- sadly lacks any error details\r\n    return headers, output\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs `output` already contains all the information needed (as JSON dump), it would be helpful if the exception raised here would include this information in the exception message.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/24","comments":2,"milestone":{"closed_issues":6,"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","login":"jacquev6","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":327146},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/milestones/2","number":2,"title":"Version 1.0: coherent public interface","due_on":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","open_issues":13,"created_at":"2012-03-08T12:22:28Z","state":"open","description":"Heavy rewrite to have:\r\n* a fully coherent public interface\r\n* usable stack-traces in case of exception\r\n* more explicit exceptions\r\n* more readable code (for library exploration, auto-completion in IDEs, etc.)\r\n\r\nSee working branch https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/tree/topic/RewriteWithGeneratedCode","id":93547},"number":24,"html_url":"https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/24","assignee":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","login":"jacquev6","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":327146},"title":"Improve error messages on broken requests","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/labels/Public+interface","name":"Public interface","color":"d7e102"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-04-30T20:01:20Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/roskakori","gravatar_id":"b58d0f1ea06b8d5de5f02c53f747ac03","login":"roskakori","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b58d0f1ea06b8d5de5f02c53f747ac03?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":328726},"id":4356743,"pull_request":{"patch_url":null,"diff_url":null,"html_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-28T14:47:02Z","body":"As the title says, `get_issues()` seems to return a max of 250 items. \nIt can't be a pagination thing I think because a page is max. 100 items long as per http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination\n\nRepro:\n\n\tfrom github import Github\n\tg = Github()\n\ttest=g.get_user('openframeworks').get_repo('openFrameworks').get_issues()\n\tlen(test)\n\nThis repo hast 940 closed and 340 open issues.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/33","comments":4,"milestone":{"closed_issues":6,"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","login":"jacquev6","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":327146},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/milestones/2","number":2,"title":"Version 1.0: coherent public interface","due_on":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","open_issues":13,"created_at":"2012-03-08T12:22:28Z","state":"open","description":"Heavy rewrite to have:\r\n* a fully coherent public interface\r\n* usable stack-traces in case of exception\r\n* more explicit exceptions\r\n* more readable code (for library exploration, auto-completion in IDEs, etc.)\r\n\r\nSee working branch https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/tree/topic/RewriteWithGeneratedCode","id":93547},"number":33,"html_url":"https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/33","assignee":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","login":"jacquev6","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":327146},"title":"get_issues() returns max. 250 items","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"e10c02"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-05-28T13:18:01Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","login":"bilderbuchi","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":327442},"id":4780155,"pull_request":{"patch_url":null,"diff_url":null,"html_url":null}}]
