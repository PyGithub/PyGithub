With `settings.eglWindowOpacity` set to 0, this allows a totally transparent window but elements drawn retain their alpha values. This enables multiple layers of OF apps or OF apps overlaying other apps\r\n\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include \"ofMain.h\"\r\n#include \"ofAppEGLWindow.h\"\r\n\r\nclass ofApp : public ofBaseApp{\r\npublic:\r\n\r\n    void draw()\r\n    {\r\n        //Set background to alpha 0\r\n        ofColor bgColor(ofColor::black, 0);\r\n        ofBackground(bgColor);\r\n        \r\n        int alpha = ofGetFrameNum()%255;\r\n\r\n        ofPushStyle();\r\n            ofColor orangeBG(ofColor::orange, alpha);\r\n            ofSetColor(orangeBG);            \r\n            ofDrawRectangle(0, 0, 500, 500);\r\n        ofPopStyle();\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\nint main( )\r\n{\r\n    ofGLESWindowSettings windowSettings;\r\n    windowSettings.setSize(1024, 768);\r\n    \r\n    ofAppEGLWindow::Settings settings(windowSettings);\r\n    \r\n    settings.eglWindowOpacity = 0;\r\n    settings.alphaFlags = DISPMANX_FLAGS_ALPHA_FROM_SOURCE; //proposed change\r\n    settings.layer = 2;\r\n    \r\n    ofCreateWindow(settings);\r\n    ofRunApp(new ofApp());\r\n    \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the above code you could start another app (e.g. omxplayer, another OF app) and an orange box would be drawn on top with transparency retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6151","id":369254388,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjkyNTQzODg=","number":6151,"title":"soundExample crahsed with `raspberry pi B+` X `raspbian stretch`","user":{"login":"icq4ever","id":530796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/530796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever","html_url":"https://github.com/icq4ever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icq4ever/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-10-11T18:41:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T20:57:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"soundPlayerFFTExample and soundPlayerExample is crashed with openframeworks 0.10.0 with clean setup raspbian stretch x raspberry pi B+(old one). it looks like something related with alsa. launching app is ok unless any play sound (ie. click to play).\r\n\r\nI can see error message `Illegal Instruction`\r\n\r\nalsa is working.

So, why would I need to install another copy of the library on Windows ? I have reinstalled the library, but eventually the problem comes back. I am guessing that a windows update may have stomped on it and removed it again.   The problem only occurs for me on w32 but not x64.   On googling around, it appears other OF users have encountered the same problem (so it's just not my installation)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6129","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6129/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6129/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6129/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/6129","id":361464541,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjE0NjQ1NDE=","number":6129,"title":"ofDirectory::sort() is slow!

noticed that with old projects which have a lot of png sequences that a project that used to take 20-30 seconds to load are now taking 15+ minutes. \r\n\r\nAll I did was add sort() after calls to listDir() ( due to the non-sorted directories Apple lovingly introduced #5852 ) \r\n\r\nTaking the current dirListExample, calling sort() with listDir() makes a directory listing takes more than 10x longer than not calling sort(), but then getting randomly ordered results. \r\n\r\nI noticed that if I sort the files first as strings instead of as a vector ofFile::References it is almost as fast as not sorting at all. \r\n\r\nI think this might be due to the extra overhead of having files loaded into memory ( even as references ). \r\n\r\nI need to put together a PR for this, the main issue I see is that I am sorting inside of listDir before even creating the files vector. The plus side is you get sorted results by default without having to call sort(); But calling sort() will still be slow.  I could prob get the fix to work in sort() too without losing the performance improvement. It might just need to rebuild the file list which is doable. \r\n\r\nThis is a comparison for sorting 110 files. \r\n```\r\nDebug\r\n time diff for file list with current sort: 0.349263 seconds \r\n
