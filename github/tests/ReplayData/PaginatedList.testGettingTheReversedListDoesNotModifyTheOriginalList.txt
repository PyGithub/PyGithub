To fix this bug we need to write a c++11 version which does not use tr1 namespace.\r\n\r\nThis could either involve:\r\n1. Writing a win/linux/mac C++11 implementation without tr1\r\n2. Writing a special implementation for libc++ without tr1 for osx\r\n\r\nI think the only difference between 1 and 2 is more testing is required for 1.
