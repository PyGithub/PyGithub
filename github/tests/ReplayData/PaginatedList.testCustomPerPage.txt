guys,\r\nHere is something strange I am fighting with the last few days. I have a PointGrey Flea3 cam, which could run at 120 fps. I am trying to run a basic application under Windows 7, using their FlyCapture SDK, although the problem I am having is also present, if I run just the basic empty example application.\r\n\r\nBasically I am doing this, at the setup() of my application, I would set:\r\n\r\nofSetFrameRate(120);\r\nofSetVerticalSync(false);\r\n\r\nand what I would get is Openframeworks running at no more then ~64 fps. The really weird thing is that sometimes after a while, the application will start running at my desired rate, but if I restart, I am back at the ~64 fps limit. \r\n\r\nSo, I dug deeper into the matter and I noticed the Sleep() method inside the ofAppGlutWindow idle_cb function. When I set the frame rate to 120 fps, the idle_cb function correctly calculates that it has too sleep for 8ms and waitMillis is indeed 8ms, but for some reason the Sleep function could not get lower then 16 ms sleep, which I measured using a suggested on the forums more accurate timer - QueryPerformanceCounter. So, I guess the problem here is the resolution of the Sleep method and the most weird thing is that sometimes it would work, sometimes it would not.  I tested this on my MacBook Pro and on my Desktop machine, so I guess it's not hardware related.\r\n\r\nI did another test too, setting ofSetFrameRate(0), bypassing the Sleep function. But then I get a resolution problem with ofGetElapsedTimef(), I still could not get a difference between the frames lower then 16ms. So I did another test with QueryPerformanceCounter and measured it against the ofGetElapsedTimef() inside the \"update()\" function and what I noticed is that when I set the FlyCaptureSDK to 120 fps, the application was indeed running in 120 frames per second, but OF was showing ~64fps. Basically the difference between frames using QueryPerformanceCounter  was 8ms, but the difference measured with ofGetElapsedTimef was 16ms. Once again I should mention, that sometimes after like 10 minutes, I would get the resolution and the application showing correct frame rate, but when I restart it will be back at the ~64 fps limit. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody actually have this problem, is this a known issue or am I doing something completely wrong here?\r\n\r\nHere is the QueryPerformanceCode, I am usuing for measurement:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass Timer {\r\npublic:\r\n\tdouble PCFreq;\r\n\tunsigned long long CounterStart;\r\n\r\n\tvoid StartTimer() {\r\n\t\t LARGE_INTEGER li;\r\n\t\t if(!QueryPerformanceFrequency(&li))\r\n\t\t\tcout << \"QueryPerformanceFrequency failed!\\n\";\r\n\r\n\t\t PCFreq = double(li.QuadPart)/1000.0;\r\n\r\n\t\t QueryPerformanceCounter(&li);\r\n\t\t CounterStart = li.QuadPart;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tdouble Timer::GetElapsedTime()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tLARGE_INTEGER li;\r\n\t\tQueryPerformanceCounter(&li);\r\n\t\treturn double(li.QuadPart-CounterStart)/PCFreq;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\nKeep up the good work,\r\nKamen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1871","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1871/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1871/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1871/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1871","id":10867389,"number":1871,"title":"ofFbo modifications to ease the use of Multiple Rendering Targets","user":{"login":"tobiasebsen","id":1135364,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0084a00a1e20e0607a9f67d2d9b992c0?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"0084a00a1e20e0607a9f67d2d9b992c0","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasebsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasebsen/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/11/labels","id":264333,"number":11,"title":"0.8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","html_url":"https://github.com/bilderbuchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/received_events","type":"User"},"open_issues":49,"closed_issues":5,"state":"open","created_at":"2013-02-11T12:15:03Z","updated_at":"2013-03-10T12:09:16Z","due_on":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z"},"comments":20,"created_at":"2013-02-11T14:18:28Z","updated_at":"2013-03-11T10:02:48Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1871","diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1871.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1871.patch"},"body":"These are just some small modifications that allows attaching textures and render-buffers of a custom format.

The problem is when binding more than one server process on the same IP to the same UDP port. This issue was raised by kylemcdonald https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/722 The solution as proposed by ofTheo was to add \r\n\r\n//#ifdef __APPLE__\r\n\t\t\t// needed also for OS X - enable multiple listeners for a single port on same network interface\r\n\t\t\tint reusePort = 1; // int on posix\r\n\t\t\tsetsockopt(socket_, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEPORT, &reusePort, sizeof(reusePort));\r\n//#endif\r\n\r\nto oscpack/src/ip/posix/UdpSocket.cpp\r\n\r\nThis does work, as it defines the SO_REUSEPORT property of the POSIX SOCKET API.\r\nThis is exactly the case where it should be used though it should be noted that this should not be limited to OSX, but also be enabled for OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD.\r\n\r\nbilderbuchi ran ofTheo's fix regarding SO_REUSEADDR on Linux. I believe what he was seeing was that when SO_REUSEADDR is added, it will keep a process from exiting with an error. What is clear now is that the code was not tested for actually receiving. To bring everyone up to speed, from my research and understanding SO_REUSEADDR allows a process to bind to an IP address before it is freed. Without SO_REUSEADDR the process will crash when it tries to bind to the same IP. I was curious and created a unicast client and a listener with pyOSC. I did this to figure if this was an oF issue or an issue with how Linux implements UDP socket connections. I found that launching more than one instance of an OSC listener bound to the same IP and port would cause the second listener to crash. When going into the pyOSC code, i found it was calling SocketServer.py. Upon inspecting this code, I found that class UDPServer has a variable for allow_reuse_address = False. When I changed this to True my pyOSC server aka the listeners displayed the same behavior as seen by bilderbuchi. I noticed however that only the first running instance was able to receive information. Upon termination of the first instance, the second instance would then receive information. I then inspected to see what the POSIX SOCKET API had to say about the issue. The answer is to use SO_REUSEPORT as discovered by ofTheo. However, there is nowhere to set this on Linux without patching the kernel. The kernel needs to be patched to add SO_REUSEPORT to UDP. This has been raised on the kernel mailing lists, and has met resistance and questioning as to why it is needed. A perfect example is testing OSC communication on a local machine! \r\n\r\nIn summery it turns out that ofTheo's fix applies to all BSD operating systems. It also should be noted for Linux users running into this issue that SO_REUSEADDR is not a complete solution and that there will be no code portable solution for Linux until SO_REUSEPORT is added to the mainline kernel. There is code existing to add SO_REUSEPORT if the user wishes to compile on their own. SO_REUSPORT works well for UDP and needs improvement (from what I have read from the lists) for TCP. I have also seen from the lists that SO_REUPSORT is an aid to system performance. Security issues are raised by some of those on the mailing lists, with talk of having SO_REUSPORT being allowed only for threads with the same PID. I believe their reasoning is for security, but that would not help solve this issue. It would only prevent multiple threads of a process from running into this issue. In fact the POSIX API is clear that a process will only be able to bind to the same ip/port as another processes if they are both using SO_REUSEPORT.\r\n\r\nI hope this post is informative and helpful and hopefully  we can contribute as a community in getting the Linux maintainers to add SO_REUSEPORT by default. Having end users recompile kernels does not help with portable code. I know there are other programmers that are asking for the same thing RIGHT NOW as this is a current issue for many other users regarding multiple processes bindings to the same IP and port. This is also a perfect example of how BSD is Unix and that Linux is something a little different. \r\n\r\nMy current solution involves creating servers that listen on unique ports and having the client transmit to multiple ports."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1836","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1836/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1836/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1836/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1836","id":10256802,"number":1836,"title":"fixed ofEasyCam so it works correctly when calling it´s disableMouseInpu...","user":{"login":"roymacdonald","id":974878,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fe632ca3d0c42747cfef88a95d942c4a?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"fe632ca3d0c42747cfef88a95d942c4a","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald","html_url":"https://github.com/roymacdonald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roymacdonald/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-01-24T00:17:33Z","updated_at":"2013-02-10T02:00:59Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1836","diff_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1836.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1836.patch"},"body":"...t function in testApp::setup()\r\nthis was being discussed here https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1834"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1829","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1829","id":10154793,"number":1829,"title":"Feature Request: Add this iOS native example with storyboards & arc","user":{"login":"rc1","id":166915,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/014e191932079a5a496436bcd0a5d6c6?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"014e191932079a5a496436bcd0a5d6c6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1","html_url":"https://github.com/rc1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rc1/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/example","name":"example","color":"d1af26"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/iOS","name":"iOS","color":"2babad"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"}],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-01-21T12:16:54Z","updated_at":"2013-02-11T13:31:50Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI have created an example project for iOS which uses storyboards and uses ARC (not OF, just the example project).

This could either be a) left as it is, b) ofxiPhoneAppDelegate's `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` could maybe do inline detection of the storyboard, c) I could add `applicationDidFinishLaunching:withStoryboard:` or `applicationDidFinishLaunching:createWindow:` to ofxiPhoneAppDelegate.\r\n\r\nStoryboards are fantastic, and I think this is quite a nice solution for having *light* implementation of OF in a more UIKit iOS app, something that is missing for the example apps imo.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRoss"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1828","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1828","id":10138126,"number":1828,"title":"feature request: adding tangents and binormals to ofMesh and ofVbo","user":{"login":"kalwalt","id":1275858,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ec3f9bd7d21934ccfbcc5242b786cd0?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"4ec3f9bd7d21934ccfbcc5242b786cd0","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt","html_url":"https://github.com/kalwalt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalwalt/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/section-3D","name":"section-3D","color":"DDDDDD"}],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-01-20T16:53:50Z","updated_at":"2013-01-20T16:54:18Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"i think it will be useful if you need to apply a normal map and to do parallax mapping of a model imported.

this great PR, #1819 it seems every more important to be a little more strict about our use of `ofPoint`.  90% of the time in the API (not a scientific estimate) we use `ofPoint/ofVec3f` when we mean `ofVec2f`.  Since the `ofVec*f` notation can be a little confusing, I'd propose a ofPoint2D typedef of ofVec2f.  Most 2D primitives (such as `ofRectangle`, the current version of `ofPolyline` are 2D in their current form.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, are people using the `.z` in ofPoint when using `ofRectangle`, etc?  I can see how it might be more convenient.  But `ofPoint` implies things that `ofRectangle` can't deliver (think `ofLineSegmentIntersection` etc).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, perhaps we should go the route of others (like cinder, toxiclibs, etc) and create a templated point / primitive, setup?  From a data and drawing standpoint 2d is no different from 3d, but when we start doing functions like `inside()` or `intersects()` then we could subclass.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just throwing this out there for discussion -- perhaps this is part of the larger API discussion that @ofZach and others have in mind."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1816","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1816/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1816/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1816/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1816","id":10022540,"number":1816,"title":"bug in ofMesh removeIndex(), removeTexCoord(), removeColor();","user":{"login":"ascorbin","id":900709,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9cff00ec4a5ef434ed3694c7f84b231b?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"9cff00ec4a5ef434ed3694c7f84b231b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin","html_url":"https://github.com/ascorbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbin/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"b31d1d"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/bitesize","name":"bitesize","color":"65a300"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/fix-proposed","name":"fix-proposed","color":"31e03a"}],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-01-16T15:43:19Z","updated_at":"2013-01-17T23:20:28Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"its possible to have more indicies than vertices, so...\r\n\r\nin removeIndex(ofIndexType index)\r\n\r\nit must be\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid ofMesh::removeIndex(ofIndexType index){\r\n  if(index >= indices.size()){\r\n    ofLog(OF_LOG_ERROR,\"Trying to remove index out of range of this mesh.

copying this from the forum - my searches didn't turn up anything\r\n\r\nfrom\r\nhttp://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,11561.0/topicseen.html\r\n\r\nHi folks,\r\n\r\nFound a bug in setting the text in textfields, in OF0073.\r\n\r\nIf you just use the normal setText method it just displays it temporarily (as if you're still editing) and doesn't save it.\r\nYou can check this by trying a getText immediately after the setText and you'll see the getText returns null. getLabelText returns the setText value, but as soon as you close the textfield, that value is gone.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want your setText to store the value immediately upon setting, you need to do this:\r\n\r\nIn ofxiPhoneKeyboard.mm:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- (void) setText: (NSString *)text  \r\n{  \r\n    [_textField setText:text];  \r\n  \r\n}  \r\n```\r\nNew code:\r\n```\r\n- (void) setText: (NSString *)text  \r\n{  \r\n    [_textField setText:text];  \r\n    [self textFieldDidEndEditing:_textField];  \r\n  \r\n}

current starting point for prototyping new ideas with OF looks like this:\r\n\r\n````c++\r\n#include \"ofAppGlutWindow.h\"\r\n#include \"ofMain.h\"\r\n\r\nclass ofApp : public ofBaseApp {\r\npublic:\r\n\tvoid setup() {\r\n\t}\r\n\tvoid update() {\r\n\t}\r\n\tvoid draw() {\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n\tofAppGlutWindow window;\r\n\tofSetupOpenGL(&window, 1280, 720, OF_WINDOW);\r\n\tofRunApp(new ofApp());\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nthat's a single-file project contained entirely in a `main.cpp`. i like it because it means i don't have to answer questions like \"should this go in the header or not\" when i'm only prototyping a small idea.\r\n\r\n@bilderbuchi just suggested that it might be helpful to have a minimal example like this in the `examples` folder to show people how they might construct a single-file example for reporting bugs or suggesting features (for example like https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1674#issuecomment-11756116). i think that could be really cool, and i'd be glad to add this if other people are also interested. so this issue is more to gauge interest.\r\n\r\np.s.: as an aside, it would be cool if we had a macro like this:\r\n\r\n````c++\r\n#define ofStart(appName, width, height, windowMode) \\\r\nint main() {\\\r\n\tofAppGlutWindow window;\\\r\n\tofSetupOpenGL(&window, width, height, windowMode);\\\r\n\tofRunApp(new appName());\\\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nand `ofMain.h` included `ofAppGlutWindow.h`, then a minimal single-file example would look like:\r\n\r\n````c++\r\n#include \"ofMain.h\"\r\nclass ofApp : public ofBaseApp {\r\npublic:\r\n\tvoid setup() {}\r\n\tvoid update() {}\r\n\tvoid draw() {}\r\n};\r\nofStart(ofApp, 1280, 720, OF_WINDOW);\r\n````\r\n\r\nthis idea is from cinder, which uses:\r\n\r\n````c++\r\n#if defined( CINDER_MAC )\r\n\t#define CINDER_APP_BASIC( APP, RENDERER )\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\r\n\tint main( int argc, char * const argv[] )

ran into the inverted bitmap string issue (#1474) again when I was drawing to an FBO which was itself drawn inside another FBO. The \"nested\" FBO was actually an internal FBO used by an addon's draw method, neatly hidden away from view.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid testApp::draw(){\r\n    fbo1.begin();\r\n    addon.draw(); // binds draws then releases an internal FBO\r\n\r\n    ofDrawBitmapString(...);\r\n    fbo1.end();\r\n\r\n    fbo1.draw(); // inverted text\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe outer FBO remains bound after the internal one releases, so openGl must be using a stack like mechanism. I can tell because the FBO contains the text, it is just inverted. The OF gl renderer only has support for one FBO, so once the internal one gets released, it thinks no FBO is bound, and won't re-invert the bitmap strings.\r\n\r\nI fixed the issue by calling `fbo1.end(); fbo1.begin();` prior to drawing the bitmap string, but a proper fix would be using a stack to keep track of bound FBOs. This will also affect anything else using the `currentFbo` variable of `ofGLRenderer`.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1741","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1741/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1741/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1741/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1741","id":9163635,"number":1741,"title":"look

OF projects, vs when it was included in a non OF project (such as a console application from xcode).   basically it chokes on the code where it defines a function called check().  \n\nthis is easy to test in any osx project: \n\n\tvoid check(){\n\t    printf(\"hello world \\n\");\n\t}\n\n\tvoid testApp::setup(){\n\t    check();\n\t}\n\nyou can also, even just add a new .cpp file, no includes, and add the check function.    ie: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/4Y1vw\n\nIf you trace this -- jump to definition -- this is because of AssertMacros.h check definition, so a quick fix is: \n\n#undef check\n\nbut it seems slight problematic that an empty file in an OF project, with **no includes**, is getting that stuff defined already.    It might be worthwhile to take a look at the project setup to try to make sure empty files, and external libraries don't have things like carbon headers being thrown at them. \n\nit looks like the

avoid this so that external files that don't have anything to do with carbon (and don't want to!) can avoid conflicts like this.

It will change the current capture size _back_ in `osxVideoRecorderExample`, but `osxVideoRecorderExample` won't know about the change.\r\n\r\nAnother fun trick is to open PhotoBooth (which must use QTKit).  If you open the standard `videoGrabberExample`, it will resize photobooth's stream.\r\n\r\nThis does not apply when a legacy capture is happening.  For instance,  if you open up [jit.qt.grab] in max5, the device will appear \"in use\" to all QtKit renderers.\r\n\r\nAnyway, device sharing seems like a great new feature, but if other capture devices don't know about the changes to capture dimension, it could be a problem.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps a warning should be thrown if the device is already open? Perhaps there is an internal capture size callback / event in the QTKitGrabber?\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1642","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1642","id":7396649,"number":1642,"title":"capitalize

merge yet!\r\n\r\nThis PR+the branch on @damiannz's repo are the working place for the refactoring of the sound system. \r\n\r\nFeatures at the moment: \r\n\r\n* ofSoundBuffer a class to store sound buffers equivalent to ofPixels. might need a setFromExternalBuffer and be implemented with float array instead of vector so it can be used to pass the native buffer around without need for copies\r\n\r\n* ofSoundFile: allows to read from sound files to sound buffers, would be good to add writting too, probably should inherit from ofFile\r\n\r\n* ofBasicSoundPlayer: a sound player that can be used on any platform that supports ofSoundStream. it uses ofSoundFile to read sound files and outputs through any ofSoundStream\r\n\r\n* ofSoundMixer: a simple sound mixer\r\n\r\n* ofSoundUtils: a utility file for sound, like commonly used sound interpolations, panning algorithm...* ofSoundBuffer\r\n\r\nSend a pull request to the __feature-ofSoundRefactoring__ branch on @damiannz's fork of oF to add things here.\r\n\r\nDev notes are

Alpha blending should be disabled when the font is drawn. But the font edge looks the same, with a color cast from background at the border, regardless if alpha blending is enabled or not.\nSetup:\nloadFont is called with default params except for font path and size.

Disable alpha blending. font color is (255, 127, 0, 255)\nIn this case, the issue is that a blackish border appear around the font. (colors like (100, 50, 0, 40) I would expect that at border, font color is maintained, only alpha is changed. (255, 127, 0, 40) or similar.\nTo reproduce it, just save the image as png, and open it with an image viewer that has a different background than the one set in the OF before drawing the font.

3.0 was released July 2012 - might be worth looking into. \n\nhttp://assimp.sourceforge.net/index.html\n\nOne thing I read stated that the 3.0 version breaks from the 2.0 api - so it might not be a straight swap.\n\nEdit: here is the changelog \n\n\n3.0 (2012-07-07)\n\nFEATURES:\n   - new export interface similar to the import API. \n   - Supported export formats: Collada, OBJ, PLY and STL\n   - added new import formats: XGL/ZGL, M3 (experimental)\n   - new postprocessing steps: Debone\n   - vastly improved IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) support\n   - introduced API to query importer meta information (such as supported\n       format versions, full name, maintainer info).\n   - reworked Ogre XML import\n   - C-API now supports per-import properties\n\nFIXES/HOUSEKEEPING:\n\n   - hundreds of bugfixes in all parts of the library\n   - unified naming and cleanup of public headers\n   - improved CMake build system\n   - templatized math library\n   - reduce dependency on boost.thread, only remaining spot\n     is synchronization for the C logging API \n\nAPI COMPATIBILITY:\n   - renamed headers, export interface, C API properties and meta data\n     prevent compatibility with code written for 2.0, but in \n     most cases these can be easily resolved\n   - Note: 3.0 is not binary compatible with 2.0\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1615","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1615/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1615/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1615/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1615","id":7138350,"number":1615,"title":"ios6

patch adds support for the QNX platforms (BlackBerry PlayBook & BB10)  to openFrameworks.\n\nThe code is based of the developPlayBook branch (https://github.com/falcon4ever/openFrameworks/tree/developPlayBook) that has been used for the NodeBeat project (http://nodebeat.com/). However, I have updated the code for compatibility with openFrameworks 0071 (develop branch)\n\nThe current code has been tested using the following SDKs\n- BlackBerry PlayBook Native SDK 2.1.0 beta 1\n- BlackBerry 10 Native SDK 10.0.06 beta 2\n\nTo develop for QNX or run the examples, you will need to download the ofxQNX add-on and place it in the addon folder of openFrameworks.\n- ofxQNX is available on github: https://github.com/falcon4ever/ofxQNX\n\n\nFor now, ofxQNX resides in a different repository for the following reasons:\n- Because I include pre-compiled libraries, the current size of the repository is about 100 MB.\n- Pre-compiled libraries are used because of the complexity involved with building them from scratch. Most of them need to be patched for the QNX compiler and Poco for QNX can't be build on Windows platforms.\n- Another reason for the size (mostly due Poco) is because it supports multiple QNX architectures and build modes. The devices all use an ARMv7 cpu, the simulator uses x86.\n- > PlayBook device (ARMv7) - Release\n- > PlayBook device (ARMv7) - Debug\n- > PlayBook simulator (X86) - Debug\n- > BB10 device (ARMv7) -

was returning strange values when the gl load was high. Sometimes when the gl task is to gpu intensive it seems to skip a frame draw which gives really short times for one frame. since the fps calculation was accumulating old values this makes the fps go higher. in general this makes the fps go up to about 70-80fps while the total frames in one second is really about 60fps even when this happens. In some systems i've seen it go to even 300-400fps when the real framerate was 60\n\nThis commit fixes that problem + makes ofSetFrameRate more accurate by using microseconds where available (osx and linux)  I've tested this reading the max and min times per frame setting the framerate and in an empty application the difference between the min and max times per frame are of about 0.1ms\n\nwould be good to test in other systems to check that it doesn't break, mostly on windows where sleep only works with milliseconds so the calculations are different and i might have introduced an error\n\nif this works properly it would be good to move this calculation to ofNotifyUpdate so different windowing systems don't need to replicate this

per email discussion beginning http://dev.openframeworks.cc/htdig.cgi/of-dev-openframeworks.cc/2012-April/004332.html\n\ni'd like to propose a couple of changes to the way ofPath works around handling Catmull-Rom and Bezier segments. \n\ni'm calling this code:\n\n\tofPath path;\n\tpath.moveTo( 100, 100 );\n\tpath.lineTo( 150, 100 );\n\tpath.curveTo( 200, 150 );\n\tpath.lineTo( 200, 200 );\n\tpath.draw();\n\nwhen i read this i'm visualizing a horizontal line segment and a vertical line segment with a curve smoothly connecting them, something like this (no.1):\n![no.1](http://i47.tinypic.com/uowfd.jpg) \n\n\nor at least (though less desirable), this (no.2):\n![no.2](http://i47.tinypic.com/11tu1cz.jpg)\n\n\nwhat i actually get is this (no.3)\n![no.3](http://i46.tinypic.com/2isglsx.jpg)\n\n\n\nwhether it's a bug or not, i think no.3 is wrong. i asked for a curve! where's my curve? also why is my 3rd point being completely ignored? \n\npossible objections to this line of thinking (aka, what Arturo said): \n\n* 'but Catmull-Rom requires 4 points'\nanswer(a): but i *am* giving it four points: (100,100), (150,100), (200,150), (200,200) (image no.2)\nanswer(b): i'm a beginner and i haven't read the docs so i don't know that 'curveTo' means Catmull-Rom, nor that Catmull-Rom needs 4 points. where's my curve???\nanswer(c): ok, so i'm only giving the algorithm one point, which means i'm doing something wrong. but wait. if you look at my code above, based on the way the API is structured (move to here, straight line to here, curve to here, straight line to here), it doesn't *look* like i'm doing anything wrong. i expect it to work, and when it doesn't i become confused and angry.\n\n* 'why don't you use a bezier instead of a curve vertex?'\nanswer: why should i need to calculate the bezier handles myself? the code can and therefore should do this for me. intuitively, stright line followed by curve followed by straight line should automatically generate control points for a clean transition from the straight segment to curve segment without corners. we can add an explicit 'please make a corner here' bFlag to the curveTo function if we want a corner.\n\n(there's an analogous case here for bezierTo: if i'm coming out of or joining to a straight line segment or another curve i would like an option for my bezier handles to be calculated automatically; similarly it'd be nice to have an option to automatically mirror a previous bezier segment's handle for the first control point to bezierTo, in order to avoid making a corner.)\n\n* 'but this is how ofCurveVertex used to work'\nanswer: no it's not. if you switched vertex types in the middle of a pair of ofBeginShape/ofEndShape, your existing points get thrown away in some circumstances. basically ofBeginShape/endShape wasn't able to handle changing the vertex types mid-path, whereas according to its API, ofPath is.\n\n\nso, what is the correct behaviour with this code?\n\n\tpath.moveTo( 100, 100 );\n\tpath.lineTo( 150, 100 );\n\tpath.curveTo( 200, 150 );\n\tpath.lineTo( 200, 200 );\n\nto me, it's something like no.1, a horizontal line segment and a vertical line segment with a curve smoothly connecting them. \n\n\ndoes anyone else expect something different?\n\nif not, let's make ofPath work this way!\n\n\n\n\n\nnotes: \n\nsource to generate no.3:\n\n\tvector<ofPoint> points;\n\tpoints.push_back( ofPoint( 100, 100 ) );\n\tpoints.push_back( ofPoint( 150, 100 ) );\n\tpoints.push_back( ofPoint( 200, 150 ) );\n\tpoints.push_back( ofPoint( 200, 200 ) );\n\n\tofNoFill();\n\tofSetColor( 128, 128, 128 );\n\tfor ( int i=0; i<points.size(); i++ )\n\t\tofCircle( points[i], 5 );\n\t\n\tofPath path;\n\tpath.moveTo( points[0] );\n\tpath.lineTo( points[1] );\n\tpath.curveTo( points[2] );\n\tpath.lineTo( points[3] );\n\tpath.setColor( ofColor( 255, 255, 255 ) );\n\tpath.setFilled(false);\n\tpath.draw();\n\n\nfor image no.1 substitute: \n\n\tpath.moveTo( points[0] );\n\tpath.lineTo( points[1] );\n\tpath.bezierTo( ofPoint( 175, 100 ), ofPoint( 200, 125 ), points[2] );\n\tpath.curveTo( points[2] );\n\tpath.lineTo( points[3] );\n\n(there are other viable locations for the bezier control handles here, but i like the way this one looks. it's easy to calculate mathematically: cast a ray from [1] in the same direction as the [0]->[1] line segment, and find the point along the ray at (say) 1/3 of the distance between [1] and [2]; this is your first control point. do something similar for the second control point.)\n\n\nimage no.2 is generated by\n\n\tpath.moveTo( points[0] );\n\tpath.lineTo( points[1] );\n\tpath.curveTo( points[0] );\n\tpath.curveTo( points[1] );\n\tpath.curveTo( points[2] );\n\tpath.curveTo( points[3] );\n\tpath.lineTo( points[3] );\n\nthis is pretty ugly code and unfortunately it creates corners at points[1] and points[2] which isn't correct in my opinion.\n\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1574","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1574","id":6698381,"number":1574,"title":"ofBitmapModes

That's kind of reasonable.\n\nBut it also means that `ofRectangle(x,y,w,h)` shouldn't exist, and that's unreasonable.\n\nI think a good guideline is that if anything would be called `load`, `init` or `setup`, then it should be in a method, not a constructor. If something would be called `set` (simple data container) then it's ok to have a constructor.\n\nWhat does everyone think? Should `ofFile(string filename)` exist? How about `ofFile(string filename, bool binary)`?

all!\n\nin a few of my addons i build an asset register to handle:\n* images\n* shaders\n* fonts\n\nThe idea is common. That on program start (and whenever you call `ofxAssets::rescan()`), it scans the `data/` folder for assets and builds the dictionaries.\n\ne.g. if my folder structure is like\n\n```\ndata/landscape.png\ndata/phong.vert\ndata/phong.frag\ndata/blur.frag\ndata/verdana.ttf\n```\n\nor sometimes i do...\n\n```\ndata/images/landscape.png\ndata/shaders/phong.vert\ndata/shaders/phong.frag\ndata/shaders/blur.frag\ndata/fonts/verdana.ttf\n```\n\nI can then access these from anywhere in my app as long as i'm including the ofxAssets header:\n\n```c++\n#include \"ofxAssets.h\"\nusing namespace ofxAssets;\n\nvoid testApp::draw() {\n    shader[\"blur\"].begin();\n    image[\"landscape\"].draw(10,10);\n    shader[\"blur\"].end();\n    font[\"verdana\"].drawString(\"is this API correct?\", 10, 10);\n\n    //or if i don't want to add the using namespace clause\n    ofxAssets::shader[\"phong\"].setUniform3f(\"position\", myVec3);\n}\n```\n\nI'd like to see this as a core add-on as I think it's rather universally useful, the code is beginning to be duplicated in different addons and the API is simple enough to avoid much deliberation.

it's always testable.\n\nthis change may seem aesthetic at first, but it's following one of the important design guideline: \"openFrameworks is consistent and intuitive: it should operate on the principle of least surprise, so that what you learn about one part of openFrameworks can be applied to other parts of it.\"\n\ni think it's also essential to get it in sooner so that as people continue writing more about OF the writing can both be consistent and up-to-date."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1432","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1432/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1432/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1432/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1432","id":5927678,"number":1432,"title":"Does

all!\n\nI need a way of having the translate, rotate and scale of an ofNode (essentially all the acknowledged parameters) act as parameters.\n\nMy suggestion before was to make parameters able to use external values (e.g. you can make your own ofParameter<ofVec3f>-type class that doesn't internally store an ofVec3f, but instead gets and sets the position of an ofNode. with that class being able to sit within the inheritance tree of ofParameter, and therefore be tied to a slider, etc).\nThis suggestion didn't get positive response as it complicates ofParameter\n\nThe next suggestion is to recode ofNode to internally use 3 parameters:\n\n```c++\nofParameter<ofVec3f> translation;\nofParameter<ofQuaternion> rotation;\nofParameter<ofVec3f> scale;\n```\n\nyou could then bind external sliders to these parameters\nwe keep the existing API\nthe biggest difference would be that you couldn't apply a projective transform to an ofNode (if you applied a matrix, we'd perform some decomposition to make it back into a Tra,Rot,Sca\n\nthe alternative so far has been to cache values somewhere, and have an update loop that checks for changes inside the ofNode\ni'd like to avoid this as it's very messy (e.g. who does this update, what is the epsilon value, etc)\n\nthis isn't an easy ask, but the type of control that it unlocks is really powerful\nso your consideration is

config file which indicates OF_ROOT is currently in `~/.ofprojectgenerator/config`. This just became a problem when I was working on Jenkins CI builds:\nOn the one hand, the dialog that pops up that wants you to select the root folder doesn't find a display to open (of course, since this is basically headless for now, and this is the only thing in the whole chain which would necessitate a display I think).\nOn the other hand, the jenkins user which by default executes these tests doesn't have a home folder, so you can't even put the file there by hand. (This I can work around by creating a home folder for this user)\nBoth these problems would disappear if one could give the OF_ROOT location to the PG as a separate argument.

Becaue it is missing in the reference on the website.\n\nI think we should discuss the naming of this function. OF has methods like `ofGetHeight()` for getting the height of the app and `ofGetScreenHeight()` for getting the height of the screen. Instead `ofImage_<PixelType>::grabScreen`[1] does not grab the screen. I tested this on arch/ubuntu/win7 and it only grabs the app (everything else is black). Maybe it should be renamed to only `ofImage_<PixelType>::grab`.

Sometimes the app shows 300+ FPS sometimes +60 sometimes 30 when setting ofSetVerticalSync(true) and ofSetFramerate(60) (or using none of the settings), and I experience some slowdowns in the ofxOpenNI thread to 20 FPS when playing an .oni file, that recover back to normal 30 FPS. Sometimes the app runs perfectly with no slow downs but it is pretty much randomly changeing even with just  an app restart or system restart. No changes in the Nvidia driver settings seem to directly and repeatetly control the FPS. The ofxOpenCV example is controlable and behaves as one would expect, but its not threaded.\n\nI am puzzeld and I do not know what could be the root of the problem. Any ideas where I could look next? Are there any instructions or patterns i should avoid when interacting with my OpenNI thread that could influence the Opengl thread?\n\nAnyone wanting to test this can reproduce this with running the sample project of gameovers ofxOpenNI called src-ONIRecording-Simple.

This would lower the barrier for people getting addons they want/need. Additionally, it would take away/reduce the need/desire to include popular addons in the OF core repo and/or release download, if addons are so easy to get, as part of a workflow we already envision the users to follow in the future (i.e. the PG)\r\n\r\n*Behaviour as it is now/soon:*\r\n\r\nAlice has an idea for a new project. She needs a couple addons for realising her project, and knows which ones. \r\nShe opens a browser to go to ofxaddons.com and/or github to download the addons if she doesn't have them yet and places them into `OF/addons/`. Alice starts the PG. The PG knows about the addons, and allows her to select them for inclusion. She creates a project and starts coding.\r\n\r\n*Desired/envisioned behaviour:*\r\n\r\nBob has an idea for a new project. He needs a couple addons for realising his project, and knows which ones. \r\nBob uses the new version of the PG to create a project. Beside the list of installed addons, the PG offers a dropdown list to select addons to download and place into the proper place. It lets Bob select if he prefers a plain download (to just use the addon), or a cloned git repo (to stay up-to-date and/or propose improvements to the addon author). Bob selects the desired addons to download, waits a while until PG reports that they're in place, and chooses all needed addons from the newly expanded list. He creates a project, and start coding the Next Big Thing, without even needing the browser! Awesome, right?\r\n\r\n*Analysis:*\r\n\r\nAlthough I realize that this is no trivial feature, I think much of what we need is already in place. \r\nPG knows about the repo structure, which addons are already there, etc., and has most of the file-manipulation logic already I think. \r\nofxaddons.com maintains a list of available addons and their locations, so I hope it's rather easy to present this in some machine-readable way for PG consumption (@obviousjim, thoughts?). \r\nWget/curl/git could take care of the download. \r\nofxGUI would have to be extended with a dropdown list, or some other way of (space)efficiently presenting the huge list of addons available.\r\n\r\nPossible issues: \r\nCross-platform way of downloading/git cloning without pulling to many dependencies (Elliot brought this up I think). Maybe have a fallback chain of mechanisms?\r\nAddon structure may not comply to what is expected (for old addons e.g.), so the project wouldn't work in the beginning. The same issue would appear on manual download, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts and Feedback, please.

!\r\n\r\nRecently, I've been in lot of languages, from C++ to ruby, passing by the colosus of javascript and the sea of php. Dropping by various and strange framework such as the Cinder, the jQuery, the Rails, the Processing, etc ...\r\n\r\n## the situation \r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed is that a strong architecture and a really ease use of add-ons makes a framework get stronger. For instance, if we take a look at Ruby, we see that the use of gems give him a powerfull advance over his friend php. \r\n\r\n### the Rubyist\r\n\r\nThis way of thinking is getting even better with the http://gembundler.com/ [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) friend. The gems have dependencies and a simple GemFile help to easily install all dependencies for one project.\r\n\r\n### the Cinderist\r\n\r\nFor Cinder, we get the block, as for OSX, it quiet easy and fast. Drag and drop and play/code.\r\n\r\n### the jQueryist\r\n\r\nWell, it is not frequent to have jQuery plugins depending on other jQuery plugins, but there are several way to handle dependencies on jQuery and JS.\r\n\r\n### the nodist\r\n\r\nThis lead us to http://npmjs.org/, which is really nice with dependencies.\r\nFor instance, if you tried cloud9ide, you know that you just have to make sure you get the proper package.json :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"node-example\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"express\": \"2.2.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file ensure that everything before running the server will be installed via npm.\r\n\r\n### the ofist\r\n\r\nRight now, we just have the addons.make file, which is nice but does not do any lifting for us. We have to verify that the ofx addons has been downloaded and is installed in the right folder.\r\n\r\n- Why not creating a script that will allow to manage dependencies compilation ? \r\nI have this wonderful ofxJSONsettings, but he depends on [JSONCPP](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/) and on boost, so here we will have :\r\n\r\npackage.json file in the ofxJSONsettings folder :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxJSONsettings\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"jsoncpp\": \"0.6.0-rc2\"\r\n    \"url\":\"http://jsoncpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp/trunk/\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"svn\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHum, then, we have our little bash script :\r\n\r\n`xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings`\r\n\r\nand for a project, we have to ensure that the make file run `xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings` if it does not find ofXJSONsettings.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to simplify and easify the use of plugin ! Hey, I want the new [mistubaRenderer](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxMitsubaRenderer) let's give a try :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxMitsubaRenderer\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"mitsuba\": \"0.1\"\r\n    \"url\":\"https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/hg/mitsuba-bidir\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"hg\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, this would be simplify if everybody use some same pattern, and respect some convention.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think about that ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","id":3614231,"number":1062,"title":"regularize

now there is a lot of duplicated code in the vector math classes. for example, normalize() and getNormalized() have separate implementations. if we follow the pattern of always implementing things in self-modifying methods, then providing copy-returning methods as alternatives, this will reduce the amount of code and make it harder to cause bugs or behavioral discrepancies.\r\n\r\n- implementations of an algorithm should always be self-modifying\r\n- copy-returning versions should be implemented using a differently named method, internally making a copy and calling the self-modifying version on the copy.\r\n\r\ne.g. something like (note, this isn't how it's implemented right now):\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f& ofVec2f::normalize() {\r\n\t\tfloat length = (float)sqrt(x*x

-\r\n\r\nwhen it comes down to multicast communication over udp, it's is important that the correct ip address of the local interface is set. Most computers nowadays have several interfaces (wired and wireless). Whereas ofxUDPManager::BindMcast uses INADDR_ANY as the local address, this might be wrong if you are not using the default interface. In my case, I connect the computers in a local wlan. The wlan device is not the primary device on my machine.\r\n\r\nTherefore I rewrote the BindMcast function adding a third argument pLocal, the local Ip address of the network interface.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool ofxUDPManager::BindMcast(char *pMcast, unsigned short usPort, char *pLocal)\r\n```\r\nchanging the line: \r\n\r\n```c++\r\nmreq.imr_interface.s_addr = pLocal == \"\" ? INADDR_ANY: inet_addr(pLocal);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich makes a different header file as well:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool BindMcast(char *pMcast, unsigned short usPort, char *pLocal = \"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the pLocal Adress is optional, if omitted, INADDR_ANY is used (backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nI've added the function:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nchar* GetInterfaceAddr(const char* interface); //returns the IP of a specified interface\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the ofxUDPManager as well.  This function returns the IP adress of an interface (e.g. en1 on a mac for the airport device). This is useful in dhcp networks, where your own address always changes. The function itself looks like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nchar* ofxUDPManager::GetInterfaceAddr(const char* interface)\r\n{\r\n\tint fd;\r\n\tstruct ifreq ifr;\r\n\tfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);\r\n\tifr.ifr_addr.sa_family = AF_INET;\r\n\tstrncpy(ifr.ifr_name, interface, IFNAMSIZ-1);\r\n\tioctl(fd, SIOCGIFADDR, &ifr);\r\n\tclose(fd);\r\n\treturn(inet_ntoa(((struct sockaddr_in *)&ifr.ifr_addr)->sin_addr));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease not that for this function, additional headers have to be included in ofxUDPManager.h:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <net/if.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you consider the changes useful, theres a copy of the two files downloadable here:\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/394122/ofxUDPManager_uh_07012012.zip\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nUrs

You should do the same for the targets of those two items. \r\n\r\nImportant: Before clicking the Build and Go, or the Run button, make sure that you choose the deployExamples project in the menu on the toolbar of the project window. (Otherwise if you leave openFrameworks as selected project and push Run or Build and Run, no application will be created or run). \r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\nHopefully this helps. \r\nCheers, \r\nIannis Zannos"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/811","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/811/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/811/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/811/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/811","id":2223158,"number":811,"title":"ofFBO causes segfault on Linux Ubuntu Lucid with i945 GPU","user":{"login":"hvfrancesco","id":614123,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e02a8a3953de9d5d9ec1c7aa8d43eca4?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"e02a8a3953de9d5d9ec1c7aa8d43eca4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco","html_url":"https://github.com/hvfrancesco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvfrancesco/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"b31d1d"}],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2011-11-13T20:49:26Z","updated_at":"2011-11-16T04:46:48Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"I'm trying this simple ofFbo example on OF 007, the system is Ubuntu Lucid, with an Intel 945 GPU.\r\n\r\n]//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::setup(){\r\n    fbo.allocate(500, 500, GL_RGBA);\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::update(){\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::draw(){\r\n\r\n    fbo.begin();\r\n        ofClear(255, 255, 255, 255);\r\n        ofSetColor(255, 0, 0);\r\n        ofCircle(mouseX, mouseY, 100);\r\n    fbo.end();\r\n\r\n    ofSetColor(255);\r\n    fbo.draw(0, 0);\r\n}\r\n\r\nI got a segfault in i915 dri, and any test using ofFbo leads to same results.\r\n\r\n\r\n#0 0x1bd3c36    _mesa_FramebufferRenderbufferEXT() (/usr/lib/dri/i915_dri.so:??)\r\n#1 0x80cc56a    ofFbo::createAndAttachRenderbuffer(this=0x85b28e8, internalFormat=34041, attachmentPoint=33306) (../../../openFrameworks/gl/ofFbo.cpp:489)\r\n#2 0x80cc352    ofFbo::allocate(this=0x85b28e8, _settings=...)

\r\n    int format,type;  \r\n    ofGetGlFormatAndType(settings.internalformat,format,type);  \r\n    glReadPixels(0,0,settings.width, settings.height, format, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, pixels.getPixels());  \r\n    unbind();  \r\n\r\nHas anyone experienced this issue – any fixes?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/752","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/752/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/752/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/752/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/752","id":1691874,"number":752,"title":"ofFbo

forum post: http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,7053.0.html\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, it's best to leave the mainThread for UIKit elements and move openGL and other things to another thread. Currently, if there's a lot of drawing then the UIKit elements are delayed and can even pause the update/draw methods entirely. Moving the drawing to it's own thread should help with this.\r\n\r\nI'm still testing, but this looks like it could be a good candidate for core integration. It has examples of threaded, single (what we currently use), and GCD (which I think is iOS 4.0 only) openGL implementation: https://github.com/Volcore/LimbicGL In my early tests, it does fix any pausing of the update/draw with the threaded example (haven't tried the others). I could use some help though trying to integrate this into OF properly.\r\n\r\nThe main example classes are here: https://github.com/Volcore/LimbicGL/tree/master/limbicgl/drivers\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/719","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/719/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/719/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/719/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/719","id":1459353,"number":719,"title":"optimize ofEndShape() to deal with simple shapes","user":{"login":"ofZach","id":142897,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach","html_url":"https://github.com/ofZach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"}],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2011-08-22T16:56:27Z","updated_at":"2011-08-22T17:38:49Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"\r\nbased on this comment, \r\n\r\nhttp://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,5319.msg33381.html#msg33381\r\n\r\nI wonder if we can be smarter in endShape() / ofPath::tessellate() and look for simple usage (3 or 4 points, etc) before tessellating, or if the slow down is just based on the use of the ofPath object. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/717","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/717/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/717/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/717/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/717","id":1458979,"number":717,"title":"suggest new calc clip planes routine","user":{"login":"elliotwoods","id":328294,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bea30676dca310e7f38269f245214944?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"bea30676dca310e7f38269f245214944","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods","html_url":"https://github.com/elliotwoods","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/following","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods/received_events","type":"User"},"labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"}],"state":"open","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2011-08-22T16:02:30Z","updated_at":"2011-08-22T16:02:30Z","closed_at":null,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"body":"change\r\n\r\nfloat ofCamera::getImagePlaneDistance(ofRectangle viewport) const {\r\n\treturn getPosition().length();

If the 'a' is lifted first, then the modified-a key int is removed from the pressedKeys set.  If CTRL is released before the 'a', then the non-modified-a key-up int is sent, and it is not erased from the pressedKeys set.  If this is repeated with different modifier+key downs / ups the accumulation occurs.\r\n\r\nUltimately, there needs to be better handling of modifier keys.  Perhaps there is a way to use the modifier masks keep track of modifier keys with a call to glutGetModifiers() in the keyboard_cb and keyboard_up_cb static methods?\r\n\r\nIt looks like progress has been made toward this in ofConstants.h\r\n\r\n\t#define OF_KEY_CTRL\t\t\t0x0200\r\n\t#define OF_KEY_ALT\t\t\t0x0300\r\n\t#define OF_KEY_SHIFT\t\t0x0400\r\n\r\nBut it seems to have stopped there.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to work on this -- any suggestions on a strategy?

method of the `ofxTCPManager`  the function will always return -1 when checking for data and there is no new data and the TCPServer has been set to non-blocking.\n\nAfter changing the code in issue 1 mentioned above i got:\n\n`ofxNetwork:addons\\ofxNetwork\\src\\ofxTCPManager.cpp: 304 unknown error: 10035 see errno.h for description of the error`\n\ninstead of `error: 0` when `errno`was used.\n\nWhich on windows is the [`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740668.aspx) or `EWOULDBLOCK` as defined in  `ofxNetworkUtils`\n\nSo  someplace in the code there should be a mechanism to check if the code is client is non-blocking and ignore the error.\nThis is `windows` only but still could be as an additional parameter to the `Receive` method. Or add it as an `switch case` for the `EWOULDBLOCK` in the `ofxNetworkUtils` and ignore the ouput and comment it.\n\nI just noticed this above when i started usin an application that i was developing on my mac an using it on windows machines this code would appear too often.\n\nSo as stated above my solution is that i added:\n\n```\n        #ifdef TARGET_WIN32 // otherwise EAGAIN & EWOULDBLOCK will create a \"duplicate case value\" on Non windows\n\tcase EWOULDBLOCK: \n\t\t// \tofLog(OF_LOG_VERBOSE,\"ofxNetwork:\"+file+\": \" +line+\" EWOULDBLOCK: perhaps non-blocking\");\n\t\tbreak;\n        #endif\n```\ncode and ignoring the output.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/589","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/589/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/589/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/589/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/589","id":976610,"number":589,"title":"setFromPixels

like to be able to know when an object has successfully initialized or loaded and OF provides for this, for the most part, but in an inconsistent manner ie\r\n\r\nofVideoGrabber::initGrabber() returns a bool, but ofVideoGrabber:bInitialized is protected and therefore not accessible\r\n\r\nwhile\r\n\r\nofTrueTypeFont::bLoadedOk is public, but ofTrueTypeFont::loadFont() returns void\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nofImage::loadImage() returns a bool and ofLoadImage::bAllocated() returns a bool, yet ofImage::setFromPixels() returns void\r\n\r\nI propose all loadable/initable objects have loading functions which always return a bool and a testable function (isInited(), isLoaded(), etc) for use after loading. Ideally, the testable functions would always be named the same ie myImage.isLoaded(), myVideoGrabber().isLoaded(), myFont.isLoaded() but of course a general name may not apply to all situations (myVideoGrabber.isInited() probably makes more sense).\r\n\r\nHell, all the load functions could be overloaded ie ofImage::load(string filename), ofImage::load(ofPixels pixels), ofImage::load(unsigned char* pixels) across different objects, ofTrueTypeFont::load(string filename), ofVideoGrabber::load(int w, int h, int deviceID). This consistency looks nice to anal me. but might be confusing to newbies and of course would break old code (unless wrapped for legacy compatibility).
