for PyGithub, it is easy to use and very complete. I just successfully used it to convert Trac tickets to Guthub issues.\r\n\r\nBut I had to learn the hard way that `create_issue()` expectes the milestone as number instead of a title. To track this down, I added the following `print` statement to `Requester.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef __statusCheckedRequest( self, verb, url, parameters, input ):\r\n    status, headers, output = self.__rawRequest( verb, url, parameters, input )\r\n    if status < 200 or status >= 300:\r\n        print output # <--- Added by me.\r\n        raise UnknownGithubObject() # <--- sadly lacks any error details\r\n    return headers, output\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs `output` already contains all the information needed (as JSON dump), it would be helpful if the exception raised here would include this

Vincent, I wanted to let you know that we've started using PyGithub over at Upverter. You can see an example of it in action here: https://upverter.com/JBionics/a07fd2563a253ccf/Programmable-RC-Car-Controller-Arduino-Shield/\n\nUpverter is a web-based schematic capture and PCB layout tool for people who design electronics. Like github, it's free for anyone to use as long as they publish their designs with an open-source license. We let designers attach a github project to an Upverter project, and use PyGithub to pull in some basic stats about the project (including a README file), and show them on the project's main

noticed that calls to a user object (e.g. user.email, user.location etc) caused multiple calls to GitHub. Looking at GithubObject.py I see several references to __completed and one to _completed (single underscore) on line 72. Changing line 72 to use a double underscore removed the repeated calls to Github.\r\n\r\nI tried to run your tests but can't figure out how to do so? I'd have left you a pull request if so. I tried \"python -m unittest discover\" and also just running the files, I'm not familiar with the format you've used. I'm happy to run with logs etc if that's useful (some guidance on how to run the tests would be super helpful too).
