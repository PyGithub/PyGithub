[{"updated_at":"2012-05-18T08:46:09Z","position":null,"body":"probably a noob question: does this completion refer to autocompletion in IDE's/editors? \nI have observed that this is pretty erratic sometimes. I'm using PyDev+Eclipse.\nFor example, in the tutorial from the readme, `g.get_u` gets autocompleted correctly, but `g.get_user().get_r` (or any method or attribute applicable to NamedUsers/AuthenticatedUser, really) does not show autocompletion to `g.get_user().get_repo()`. Is that by design? It makes exploring the library/API a bit cumbersome.
