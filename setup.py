        ========

        First create a Gihub instance::

            from github import Github

            g = Github( "user", "password" )

        Then play with your Github objects::

            for repo in g.get_user().get_repos():
                print repo.name
                repo.edit( has_wiki = False )

        You can also create a Github instance with an OAuth token::

            g = Github( token )

        Or without authentication::

            g = Github()
